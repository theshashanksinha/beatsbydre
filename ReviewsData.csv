R3TLWEZHK2WZG8,B00HVLUR18,5.0 out of 5 stars Great studio headphones.,Kindle Customer,5,"If you've ever been in a studio, chances are you've used an Audio Technica set of headphones to monitor. There's no frills or gimmicks to it, it's a great set of headphones at a really good price. If you record they're perfect for plugging into your amp as a monitor. The sound is very balanced and clear. If you're wanting booming bass, these aren't what you're looking for. They are your standard analog connection, it comes out of the box with a 1/4"" adapter so you can plug into amps and other stuff, but without the adapter it is your typical 3.5mm headphone jack. The headset itself has no controls whatsoever on it, they're designed for studio work so they're entirely at the mercy of your output for volume control and all that. They are over-ear ear cups, and they don't bleed too much sound. They have a 15 degree swivel to better fit your ears, they're very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, and the adjustment is easy enough and stays where you set it.","August 14, 2024",AFEIJB6UTG3Y32YD7MHDE2NEPWYQ,True,6.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.29480392156862745,Positive,0.9761,Positive
R3VPAE7YDR5SKY,B00HVLUR18,5.0 out of 5 stars WOW !,"A fan from Meriden, CT",5,"So I got these yesterday, and I know I am not going to keep them for long (more on that later) so I want to get this review in ASAP. First off, while I know what I like & I can recognize quality, I am definitely NOT an audiophile, so I'm not going to try & tell you in TECHNICAL terms why these headphones are so great, but I can give a layman's perspective. Also, I am going to do a lot of comparing to the Samson SR850's I just bought AND my standby Koss PortaPros (which I compared the Samson's to in my review of them) Anyway, lets get started.First of all the looks of these. My 13 year old daughter unboxed them while I was at work & immediately exclaimed ""These are NICE !"" With that, she put them on, plugged in her iPod Touch & didn't take them off until I got home several hours later. This from a kid who's favorite headphones are a purple pair of Knockoff Beats I bought at a flea market. They are MUCH better looking than the Samsons. The earcups are smaller & lower profile, and the headband is covered in a stylish black leatherette. There is a LARGE AudioTechnica logo across the top of them, but who's going to be looking at the top of your head ?As far as comfort goes, they are very comfortable, They are much lighter than the Samson's, and as I said smaller. The ear pads are suitably soft & covered in the same leather like material as the headband. And while I doubt you could lie on your side comfortably with them on, they would be MORE comfortable than the Samson's in that position.As for build quality, they are REALLY light, which worries me a bit, but they seem very solid. The main structure is definitely metal and the wires are thick & well covered. The plugs also look a step up from your average headphone connector. While I am sure my kids would manage to break them eventually, I think they would last longer than your average headphone. And with me, they will be just fine.Finally, lets talk sound. They sound AWESOME ! Really awesome. Much better than headphones at this price should sound. When I listened to the Samson's the first time I knew they sounded better than my Koss' ... but not by a lot. These are OBVIOUSLY better. The bass response is better, and everything else is CRYSTAL CLEAR ! Just stunning. That being said, they are not as loud as the Samson's which kinda surprised me since they are smaller & closed back. But because of the better bass & improvements across the full range of sound, I would definitely put these ahead of the Samson's AND the Koss' & I am sure ANYONE who heard them all side by side by side would agree.Now there are a few negatives. Like I said they are smaller & Lighter than the Samson's. And I was looking for something LARGER ... so in that respect, they are going away from what I was looking for. And I still am surprised the Samsons are slightly louder. With the bigger size they should need more power to drive them properly. But since the M20's have less sound leak than the SR850's, this is really a non-issue.And while they are very comfortable, after wearing them for a short time its clear that my ears are sweating in the M20's where they were not in the SR850's. Again, it may be because the latter are semi-open, but I think its because of the cloth covering on the SR850's pads AND because they are bigger.Overall, even with the negatives, I would recommend these over the Samson SR850's w/o question. But, if that extra $15.00 means a lot to you, the Samson's are still an EXCELLENT Choice. And they will probably be my choice, since once my son HEARS these. he will be wanting to trade me the Samson's for them.UPDATE: I have had these for just about 36 hours & I just had a perfect stranger come up to me & ask me if I liked them.l He obviously knew a lot more about headphones than I do & has much better equipment (a $170 pair of BeyerDynamics) but he was impressed with these especially at the price.UPDATE to the UPDATE: I recently bought a Fiio E6 Headphone Amp & when my son comes home from College, I will try these out with the Amp. Considering how much they improved my Samson SR850's (I would put that combination AHEAD of these now) I am sure they will sound even more awesome. However, I will NOT be buying that Amp for my son. If he wants one, he can buy it himself.IN RESPONSE TO .... the two questions .... First off the Amp improves the M20's as much as it improves the Samson SR850's. The sound is cleaner, and I prefer using the degraded setting on the amp with increased volume on my source on these as well.Second, as I said without the amp, these sound nearly as good as the Samson's WITH the amp. So I feel I have done enough for my son in that respect. If he wants to UP the quality with the amp, that's his choice. Just because I am not paying for it, doesn't represent my feeling for him one way or another. Of maybe it does. Either way I feel secure in my role as a parent & the opinion of one crank won't affect that.","October 14, 2015",AGWHYCMNVGRTOSJECQPSQJSTQNGA,True,34.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.26445952380952376,Positive,0.9995,Positive
RWAQOPPXBBXUJ,B00HVLUR18,5.0 out of 5 stars Real nice wired headphones -- used with Stereo only,ChrisC,5,"I'm not a mega audiophile but wants some wired headphones so I could listen to my more challenging records without torturing my wife. These headphones are super comfortable and sound great attached to my Rega amp via the quarter inch adapter. I can listen at a low volume and really get the depth of the records super well. The cable is really long -- I had to loop it and use a cable tie to keep it from going all over the place -- which is really nice and would be great if you were using these with a floor standing desktop PC or something.There's no noise or crackle with these and the audio quality is nicely pure. I am sure there are better headphones but for listeing to rock vinyl these were exactly what I was looking for, and deliver great results for a good price.They are not too heavy on my head, the ear pads feel good. I suspect there are not replacable but totally comfortable to wear for a couple hours.","July 10, 2024",AEPZ5OPRZQ56FWDAYQR5LMETCPWA,True,3.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.4036796536796537,Positive,0.9966,Positive
R5HWA5E3DKNKY,B00HVLUR18,4.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones for their price and quality!,Madison B.,4,"These headphones are amazing. I only have small issues with them.PROS:- Excellent price- Perfect audio quality and surround sound- Great for gaming, video editing, and listening to music- Good noise cancellation (a little too good at times)- Snug on the head but comfortable and breathable- DurableCONS:- The original earmuffs are a pleather-like material. They tend to crack and split at around the 8 month mark.- The earmuffs get less plush and began touching my ears at the 10 month mark.- I ended up needing to purchase a new set of earmuffs that were fabric instead.Because these headphones were designed for working with audio, they excel when it comes to audio quality. Video editing, gaming, music and online calls are fantastic with these headphones. It doesn't sound like the audio is coming from a tin can and the bass is clear and crisp.Purchasing new earmuffs seemed like an initial pain at first, but it greatly improved my audio experience. I was able to customize my headphones and increase their lifespan. They are more comfortable than before.The price for these headphones are a steal for their quality. If this is the quality of Audio-Technica's lower tier headphones, I'm very confident that their higher tier products meet and exceed standards.","December 29, 2022",AHWBQJAFYMF23X5I6LHTVEVBJ6XQ,True,10.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.3658414502164503,Positive,0.9861,Positive
R3HKFFSH2GU6VG,B00HVLUR18,5.0 out of 5 stars What are you waiting for?Get this!,Amazon Customer,5,"Looking for a budget friendly pair of headphones and don't care of wireless technology and ant to remain friends with your wallet? Well then your search has finished.I collect headphones since listening to music all day seems to be a requirement for my lungs to breath, o I can say I have try a lot of headphones through the years, and this headphones get it just right in a lot of ways.There is not such a thing as the ""perfect pair of headphones"", you should always keep this in mind if you are planing on going crazy with the headphones shopping or if you are just in the hunt for a new pair. Being this said, if your main interest is finding a well sounding-budget-friendly-headphones, this is juts for you.This are monitor headphones, so they are kinda meant or target for an audience working in music studios, which means that sound is very well balanced, bass is not overwhelming at all and I must say is not too strong either, but the overall sound of this headphones is just as clear as it can be! You will not find another pair of headphones this well balance and build for the price.Build quality on this things is pretty amazing too. My hands have never felt a so solid $40 pair of headphones before, my eyes have not seen this beautiful build on any other headphones in this price range, it's just beautiful.Being that said, they are not very stylish but don't have an ugly design either. They are mostly made of hard plastic (very durable feel plastic, like, very very durable feel; Like Fisher's price little baby's car type of feel) with the exception of the adjusters which are made of metal. The fit is very comfortable and they provide just a great sound isolation. They don't get hot or hurt your ears after long listening sessions (I use them 9hrs a day on an average,never had a problem with them) and sound isolation provides almost a sound cancellation quality as the one provided by my Sennheiser PXC 550s.Things to keep in mind:Sound quality is pretty flat, if you are into a more vibrant and bassy sound experience, I suggest checking the M40X instead or the M50X,Cord is not detachable, and this is pretty much the only I don't like from this headphones. Being able to detach the cable adds more convenience to the product, since this makes your headphones a little more durable, since they are easier to take care of and also make it easier to travel. In the headphones defense, the cord is super high quality, probably the best quality I've seen in a wired headphone before.However, since this headphones are meant for in studio listening, the cord is also super long, so if you are planing on using this headphones outside your PC set up or outside your house, you should really take this in consideration.VERDICT:If you want some very high quality budget friendly headphones, this is just the pair you need. This headphones are very well made, sound quality is clear and well balanced (lacking some bass :( ) and they are very suitable for long periods of use.If you want a more vibrant and bass heavy sound, but remain in budget, check the M40X instead or the M50X.And if you still want to remain on this price range, but need more bass for the price, check Skullcandy headphones, they have a lot of budget friendly and stylish headphones and most of them have a rich and powerful bass, though keep in mind their build quality is not the best and sound signature is not as balance as Audio Technica or Sennheiser.","December 3, 2018",AHSHEGC6JRPG5BPZNWCF2ENVOVVQ,True,23.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.21836839953295648,Positive,0.999,Positive
RNL42S9FI2IDE,B00HVLUR18,5.0 out of 5 stars very sturdy with a sturdy cable,Ramanathan Muthukaruppan,5,"Before we go furthur into the review, I want to be clear that I am no Audio expert or someone who works on editing videos/audios or work in audio monitoring. I just wanted to upgrade to a headphone from my earbuds. I have tried on many headphones in the shops and malls.PROS:1.Premium build. very sturdy with a sturdy cable.2.Great comfort. Very soft padding and the headphones themselves are very light.3.Great value for headphones and monitoring headphones category. This is the best bang you can get for this price range.4. Unbelievable sound clarity and perfectly flat awesome output which delivers the whole range of music(you can literally hear all the instruments, vocals in the music)One potential Con which might also be a pro for some: very long cable(almost 10 feet and this is not detachable)Now to the product itself:1.Design: The design is straight forward professional and simple. The product feels premium though it doesn't have the pizzazz that Beats and other headphones have. It is mostly plastic with the base of construction is metal band on which the padding and plastic is added. they are very light and comfortable to use. They also do a very good job of noise isolation though it is not advertised for this feature. I have been using it at times for more than 2 hours and it feels very comfortable. The headphone is over the ear design so it covers your ears completely and rests on your head not on ears. The soft padding which might be faux leather or some form of synthetic leather is very very comfortable. it is also provided with a pin that is 6.35mm and also the standard 3.5mm. I guess the additional 6.35mm is for audio equipments that are used in editing/ recording areas.2.Sound quality: you have to experience it to understand how good the quality is. This is the area where i believe this headphones beat other headphones out of the park. You hear precisely how the music was designed in first place with no unwanted peakof bass or mid ranges like how beats and some other headphones deliver. So for the fans of bass this might not be a great choice. but one thing for sure is that, You can hear every bit of the audio equipment used on the songs very distinctly even in moderate volumes. I am the kind of guy who wants to listen to all the instruments and vocals. With other earbuds and ear phone i usually have to crank volume to unsafe levels to hear all the range of instruments used in a song because the ear buds amplify or magnify the basss or mid range. This headphones are the best Flat headphones you can get for this price which delivers the sound how the composer wants you to hear it. The other difference I notice is that with earphones or ear buds you feel that the music is happening inside your head when you hear songs. With this headphones you feel like it is playing in the environment not in your head like in a hall.Now to the only potential Con of the product: The cable provided is not removable from the headphones and they are very long (10 feet). This might not make it as portable as some would like it to be. I personally do not find this as a con as i manage by rolling and binding the excess cable with the plastic strip provided with that usually accompanies the cables.","April 6, 2017",AEEEI7BTCBOG4XRDL2BAAPBRHIBA,True,15.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.19790909090909087,Positive,0.9897,Positive

R13E4FZNZ01HJV,B00HVLUR18,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Budget Friendly Headphones,Michael W.,5,"I purchased the Audio-Technica ATH-M20X Professional Studio Monitor Headphones in black a few months ago, and I must say I'm thoroughly impressed with their performance.

R2M70COELLB8FA,B00HVLUR18,"4.0 out of 5 stars My First ""Hi-Fi"" Headphones, Compared to Other Headphones Indepth",Quen J.,4,"UPDATE, BUILD QUALITY:Well, I'll be damned, its been exactly a year since I wrote this. It was pure luck that I checked my reviews today.Anyway, build quality.The M20xs I bought a year ago are still going strong, and I use them constantly when I am not on my computer. The cable is fine, the gold plating has worn off of the plug (that's normal after a lot of use), and the plastic doesn't appear to be worn. If I cleaned this thing very well, it would look brand new. However, not everything is in perfect condition, and that would be the padding.I started to notice after a while that the earcups were starting to feel harder and harder. As a sanity check, I took a look at my dad's m50xs to see if they were still soft, and they were (he doesn't use them that much anymore). I looked into it, and apparently, the fake rubber-leather stuff Audio Technica uses in their earcups slowly deteriorates over time by getting harder and eventually cracking due to the stress of cushioning. This is a result of constant contact with body oils (this is why my dad's pair is still soft). Thankfully, these are replaceable, but they are $25 for a pair, which is quite a bit. I got these headphones for $30 dollars while they were on sale, for perspective. There is also the chance that they use some cheaper earcups in the m20xs, which wouldn't surprise me. In which case, the replacement earcups for the m50xs could be considered an upgrade.What is more worrisome is the headband. Unlike the m50xs, which have a higher quality rubber on the headband, the headband on the m20xs is made out of the same material the earcups are. You can't replace it. Although its unlikely that the headband will get severely damaged from cracking since it doesn't exactly cushion, I can still see some dents in mine that don't go away.Other than that, these are still my favorite general purpose headphones, and I still recommend them. I'm on the edge of replacing the earcups though. If it does break at some point, I might aim for the m40xs due to the shorter cable options, better build quality/materials, and better sound. I'll give it two more years and see what happens to them.REVIEW:So, I have never been wealthy enough to own a good pair of headphones. Hearing about the constant praise of Audio-Technica, I decided to pick of their budget pair of monitors, the ATH-M20x. My father has a pair of their M40x or 50x, but I am pretty much not allowed to touch them. That's why I can't say which ones they are.As perspective and for comparison, the main headphones I used before these were the Sol-Republic v8 tracks, and I use a Logitech G230 gaming headset currently for my desktop.The song I tested between these headphones was Ocean Man by Ween, because of the formidable range in pitch. I also remembered the song the day I did this, so it was a bit nostalgic for me to listen to it again.SOUND QUALITY:Now, the first thing that struck me with these headphones was that the bass was much less compared to the other headphones. Now, this isn't a bad thing, because it let me focus on the other tracks in the song, such as the guitar and percussion, which became much brighter. This made the song sound much clearer than my other headphones, which lacked a little in mids and highs. My Sols overall had much more bass, but the rest of the frequencies seemed filtered out because of it. It's mostly the same story with my g230s, but the highs are much better than the sols. Realizing this, I finally figured out why I couldn't hear footsteps very well in the game Counter Strike Global Offensive, which encourages me to buy another pair of the M20x for my desktop, as well as a mic. The only real issue I have with the M20x at this point is that I cannot hear bass drums very well if they aren't mixed loud enough, which is disappointing, as percussion is one of the most important factors in music to me. Overall, these have generally amazing performance in the audio range, despite the bass seeming only a tad bit weaker than it should be. If they boosted up a tiny bit, I would be satisfied. Not worth to take a star off however, especially for the price.Another thing to note is that these headphones are higher in impedance than normal, so I have to near max out my volume on my phone to get somewhere acceptable to me. This isn't a problem, but I'm afraid I may get some distortion in some songs. This is also sad, as I use a separate Creative Zen audio player for my high quality CD rips, which don't go as loud as my phone, making it essentially useless. They also don't really like to plug into my phone with the case on, so I have to jam it in the jack and hope it doesn't spring out. This is along with the other problem with my audio jack, which is that they always think I'm using an inline mic unless I unplug and re-plug and hope they see them as regular headphones. If it doesn't, then bumping the cord can cause google to start voice detecting, which is very annoying, as well as randomly pausing and playing a song. To reinforce it, this is a problem with my PHONE, not the plug. This is more of a me problem, however, they still have issues being plugged into a phone with a case. Making the end coned and the adapter it comes with internally coned would solve this problem.BUILD QUALITY:Now, one of main reasons why I bought a g230 was because they are very well built, and could take multiple falls off of my desk. Same goes for the Sols, which are pretty much designed like a tank due to the super strong headband and hard but not brittle plastic. The M20x however, seems like it would need a bit more care with the headband, since it is not topped with plastic. I usually just throw my Sols into my backpack everyday, because it can handle it. These will need a bit of extra attention to not tear up the foam on the headband. I tried buying a hard case from Caseling , but the description lied to me and said that these headphones would fit. They didn't, and now I have to return it as soon as possible to get my 13 bucks back. They do fit my dad's well though because they fold, and is a pretty good case. Otherwise, the ABS plastic is nice on the drivers making them strong, and the headband has spring steel metal in it. There are no visible defects anywhere, not even unmixed plastics or rough spots on the foam. This is fairly impressive for a product made in Taiwan. Another thing I would have liked would be to color the logo inset on the sides of the drivers, it would make it easier to see. I assume this is to differentiate different models.Now, the cord I have a bit of an issue with. The cord itself is very nice; it's well insulated and flexible. The jack is nice too, it appears gold plated and has a nice bend protector. The issue I have is that it's way to freaking long, at a staggering 3 meters. This may be a good thing for some people, but I am going to be walking around with these. I have to coil up the wire (thank god for that insulation) and put a cable management strip on it to shorten it. Now, there is a good 4 inch diameter coil in my pocket that is 1/2 an inch thick, and is VERY annoying. If they could have at least shortened it to maybe 1 meter, I would not be writing this. This is worth a star for me, so off it goes. Despite this, the cable has to be one of the best impeding headphone cables I have encountered, keeping out eddy currents very well, which would cause distortion with the huge coil I have to lug around. A good way to test if a cable is well insulated or not is to try and use the cable as a stylus on a touch screen. If the screen reacts in any way while playing music, the cable has failed the test. No matter how I tried, looping it, squishing it against the screen, it would not be detected. That is a good sign for a good cable, as no electrical fields are going through that thing. As a solution to the coil, I may do some research on the internals of the cord, and shorten it myself. If you are also hateful of this issue, the better ATH models have interchangeable cables that can be much shorter. To me, it isn't worth it to pay 30 to 40 extra dollars for that feature.COMFORT:So, my g230s are a very comfortable pair of headphones for me to wear, as they are over ears. My Sols on the other hand are on ear, which was a huge issue to me when I bought them. It's not that they were uncomfortable, but it was because of an odd problem I have with my right ear. My ear canals are extremely small, so I can't use earbuds, which is really my main reason of buying full on headphones. In this case, the Sols would squeeze my right ear shut! There would be no music to my right ear unless I physically held the driver, and stretched my ear a bit. Now, the M20x are also over ear, so that's great for me. It's actually the main reason why I bought these, I wanted a nice pair of over ears that would not impede my hearing. Not only this, I would say they fit even better than my g230s due to the many degrees of freedom, so I am extremely happy here. My issue was solved due to these headphones. The actual foam the headphones use is nice, definitely on the drivers. The headband foam on top is durable and a bit stiff, but not noticeable. The bottom foam seems the same as the drivers, so no problem there. All of the foam seems to be wrapped in a thin fake leather material, and it feels nice. My g230s are just wrapped in perforated fabric, which makes it a tad itchy.MY OWN JUDGEMENT:Now, because I like nice things, I want it obvious what I'm using is nice and worth it. I like to make a statement, so I buy things that fall under these categories:1. Looks cool2. Does it's job well3. Lasts a long timeSo, for it looking cool, I would say ""eh."" As I previously stated, the logo isn't painted in, so they just look like headphones from afar. My Sols on the other hand, look 100% sweet, with it's circular drivers, solid looking headband, minimalist logo, and shiny plating (that wore off around the edges of the drivers, sadly). These don't have that aesthetic I'm looking for, but they do look like monitors, which kind of makes up for it. To me, they just look intermediate, not pro.For doing the job well, that is a definite yes. The cool factor to me can immediately be vetoed in the case that something works like a well oiled machine. This is that case. They just sound good, and anyone who would borrow these would tell. My sols aren't that good sounding, and my g230 is okay, so these are technically the best headphones I own at the moment. A case where this wouldn't be true would be Beats by Dre. Yes, the headphones look very nice, iconic even. Despite this, they pretty much are just a step up from those 5 dollar Koss headphones you buy at drug stores when you have nothing else to use (those headphones are very good for the price though, so I like them for that).I don't know for certain yet if these will last a long time. This is another factor that directly goes with doing the job well, as having these factors multiply each other makes for a godly product. My Sols and g230s definitely fall under this category, as they have both lasted me 2 years. The Sols are almost done for, however, as the right driver's plastic cone buzzes on certain frequencies. The g230s look literally brand new and haven't degraded audio wise, so they have served me well, and will keep doing so. Beats by Dre also do not fall under this factor, as they must be treated like kings, or either they will shatter the moment you look at them (an anecdote from a friend). Because it misses the two most important factors, Beats headphones are useless to me, especially with the price they ask for. I will have to live with the M20xs for a while to see how well they do with this factor, and I am predicting another strong yes. And even if they only last me a couple months, they are still only $30, an amazing price for what these headphones are. One thing I realized that may break them is extending the drivers over and over again. The metal tracks that are attached to them go in and out of the headband, and you can feel them moving inside through the foam. You can even pinch it and make it really hard to move it (annoying sometimes), which means they aren't encased in anything. This leads me to predict that at some point, they will poke through the band. Because of this, I will not shorten them every time I stow them away. Someone posted a picture that looked like this happened to them, so I will watch out.OVERALL:These are an amazing pair of headphones that meet many of my quality standards, as I am a bit of a snob. They sound great, but bass drums can be too quiet or hard to distinguish. They are made very well, despite the freaking long cable and too thick of an end for the jack. They are very comfortable, and solved the issues I had with other headphones I owned. They succeed my personal checklist, but I will need to test for durability. So, as a final statement: if you are on a budget and want nice over ears for sitting down and listening to music, pick up a pair of ATH-M20X headphones. If you have more money, shoot for the M40x or m50x if you want to walk around or need better quality. I am pretty satisfied despite my current situation, so I hope you can enjoy these headphones more than me.","December 3, 2016",AFZMJE2SPLP7WI4FUMDGP5QAL4MQ,True,336.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.1627449835815978,Positive,0.9998,Positive
R3PSS4EB4GUKPV,B00HVLUR18,5.0 out of 5 stars Excelentes para empezar,Juan Pablo Contreras,5,"No tengo mucha experiencia con audífonos de este tipo. Sin embargo, este par de audífonos ofrece una experiencia muy buena teniendo en cuenta el precio.La construcción es muy sólida a pesar de ser en su mayoría de plástico. Los audífonos son bastante más cómodos de lo que se ven en fotos o en vídeo. Sin embargo, me llegaron a cansar el pabellón auricular después de sesiones largas de uso, aunque puede que esto sea un problema personal.El cable no es removible y es bastante largo, lo que puede resultar incómodo para los que tenemos un set-up de escritorio, pero puede que sea de utilidad para aquellos que practican con su instrumento de pie o desde una distancia razonable.Todas las frecuencias están bien balanceadas, resaltando sobre todo una curva en su mayoría plana tirando a alzar más las frecuencias bajas. Sin embargo, las frecuencias altas están bien, por lo que no resultan molestas ni sibilantes. Debido a esto, puede que no sean la mejor opción para producir. Puedo recomendar estos audífonos para gente que quiere usar plugins de guitarra o bajo para practicar en sus cuartos sin hacer ruido, por medio de una interfaz de audio o una pedalera conectada a la PC.","July 24, 2024",AEKDF7MJHVWSKIHJII4DUZVXB34A,True,0.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.0,Neutral,-0.969,Negative
RBR1P8191MY57,B00HVLUR18,4.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones you can get under $100,David,4,"These were my first forray into the audiophile world and man have they been a blessing. As a gamer I've always bought ""gaming"" headphones, which on top of commanding the ""gamer"" price premium, don't usually sound all that good. But these make everything from music to gaming a joy.I've never had any issue with the cable which was an issue with other headphones as they failed to connect after a year or two due to cheap cables. They have a very simple design which I like and they sound much clearer than other headphones at an even higher price point. The components of the audio in things like music are very easy to isolate and hear without getting muddled and unclear.These are not what I'd use out and about however as they are rather large and clunky and don't have features like Active Noise Cancelling, so they aren't very portable.Although I personally don't use it, the fact it comes with a different sized jack adapter is nice.Some of the issues I can think of are the non-removable cable, so if it does have an issue, you can't just replace the cables, but again after 2 years I've had no issues so I haven't had to deal with that for now. Also, the ear cups are very small so they aren't very comfortable to wear with my ears facing the speakers and I have to fold them into the cups, which for long wear times gets very unpleasant.","June 30, 2024",AEOG6S4BIAEPJOJTHGIZFNVTYVPQ,True,0.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.10301242236024848,Positive,0.1346,Positive

I love the way good speakers pressurize a space. But I have neighbors.And zero experience with headphonesLet's face it no one wants to listen to someone else's music so out of some sense of respect for my neighbors - I bought these on a bit of a whim.I also bought them because, in my almost all tube system, my DAC has headphone outs. I can use them with out turning on class A power thirsty amps.My first impression was not good and thought about returning them. They sat here for a couple of weeks until I finally plugged them back in and spent some late night hours working and listening to music. They keep growing on me and suspect they will get better as they "" open"" up a bit more.Tonight they probably have about 10 hours on them .They are accurate. Tonally they are not exactly to my liking but than again my reference is tube amplification through speakers pressurizing a space. This is completely different.Not better or worse - just different.And tonight I thoroughly enjoyed them.Their accuracy is the key here- wow.I know what expensive gear is and I know there are far more expensive headsets than these.But I'm starting to really like themIf you like a a recording studio monitor sound to hear what's going on - this may be for you.If you want a colored sound - bass or top end heavy - give it a pass.

They are also great for those who just want nice headphones to listen to music with if you have an audio jack since there is no Bluetooth. Great value for the money. They are on the cheaper side due to the build quality I believe. They are primarily made with plastic and feel cheap; however, the sound quality is fantastic and they are comfortable so it really makes up for it.

R1ZI9KV5EV8JLZ,B00HVLUR18,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Quality for a Low Price,Amazon Customer,5,"The Audio-Technica ATH-M20x Professional Studio Monitor Headphones is the best pair of headphones I have owned. When my other headphones gave out, just from normal wear and tear, I asked my friends and family what kind of headphones to buy, and they all said to get Audio-Technicas. So I took their recommendation and bought this pair. There are many pros and very few cons to these headphones that I will explain later.Pros• The priceo These headphones are $49.00, a pretty low price for headphones. The last pair of headphones I owned, HyperX clouds, cost $100, and I can already tell the audio quality is better; but more on that later. In addition to the low price these headphones have free 2-day shipping if you have Amazon Prime.• Audio Qualityo Like I previously stated this pair of headphones out performed my old pair in playing music, watching TV or movies, and playing video games. The sound is crisp and clear and has a good range. The quality is really amazing for a pair of headphones this cheap.• Designo I really like the design of these headphones, it is simple and for me I don’t need a fancy design to be satisfied, but some people might want a flashier or more futuristic design. A little con inside this pro is that it only comes in one color if you care about that: personally I don’t. Another part of the design that I like is the long cord, the last pair that I owned I could not even lean back in my chair on my computer using it. So far it hasn’t been tangled too terribly like I expected, but I only use it at my computer so I have not worn them outside yet.Cons• No good place to put mod mico I use these headphones for playing PC games and talking with my friends so I needed a place to put a mod mic. The one spot that worked, right below the logo on the side, is a little far away from my mouth so I am pretty quiet. This is a really minor inconvenience, but something to consider if you are going to buy a mod mic with this pair of headphones.• No noise cancellingo If you are planning to wear these on an airplane or some other noisy place beware that these do not have the best noise cancelling. They have big ear cuffs that provide some natural noise cancelling, but do not have any real noise cancelling technology. The lack of noise cancelling does make sense with the low price point.Overall I would definitely recommend this pair of headphones to my friends and family. It is a low price with good audio quality and a solid design. The minor cons do not affect my rating. This is a great product and I will continue to buy their products and recommend them to my friends and family.","September 21, 2018",AF2YM4HHPGZX3SCCEU25MNO6OPDQ,True,3.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.14972962066182405,Positive,0.9976,Positive
R1MLQ3C929B3AL,B00HVLUR18,4.0 out of 5 stars A fantastic sounding set of Headphones a great price!,GuitarPlaya,4,"The Audio-Technica ATH-M20X Professional Studio Monitor is an excellent headphone for its sound. I usually listen to music at work and wear headphones to avoid disturbing my co-worker nearby. I play music from a Dell laptop loaded with Linux OS and MX-Linux KDE desktop. I have DAC connected to the computer and use the ATH-M20X exclusively. The overall sound of the headphones (with EQ enabled on the via the Linux Pulseffects EQ module) is natural and clean; no distortion coloration of the audio at all. The bass is not ""boomy .""The mids and high frequencies sound natural. However, the music comes alive when you ""tweak"" your audio with a 30-band equalizer. It took me weeks to make my music sound natural without overdoing the bass and high frequencies. Now that I've finally configured my tunes, the ATH-M20X effortlessly handle the natural mids, deep bass and crystal highs like a champ without my ears feeling fatigued from over-processed music. The ATH-M20x does not have the cancellation feature. But the headphone cushions do a great job of keeping outside noise at a minimum with no sound going through them. The only thing that kept me from rating a perfect five stars is that the headphone fits tight over my ears. Probably because I wear them for eight hours, five days a week. Other than that, just re-adjusting the headphone gives me the needed relief. But, for the price, these headphones are phenomenal.","May 8, 2023",AHNYQN3RABXDSEBZRHRSULN3ZJLA,True,4.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.14943650793650795,Positive,0.9695,Positive
R360J8S6G5EJLT,B00HVLUR18,4.0 out of 5 stars Best hifi value for headphones around,RSepulveda,4,"This is the best bang for the buck headphone under $150 period. I've been searching with my young daughter for good over the last headphones that have good sound and avoid the in the ear issues we know of and potential long term damage of them. We've tried every mass market headphone up to $250 at the big box stores. The difference between $100 and $250 headphone is slight - a little more clarity and midrange with increasingly over boosted bass that sounds muddy at best.We went elsewhere and bought a Project One headphone that was my previous budget pick. The m20 is a significant step up from the Project. These are the most balanced sounding headphone I've heard at any price of anything available at the big box stores. Voices are perfectly balanced with bass and highs. Making it perfect for all types of music and great for protecting young ears.The downside are few and nitpicking. I would give it a 5 for the value and performance alone but I know it won't work for everyone. For one, it is very revealing of your source. So if you use it with a crappy tablet or smartphone with low quality mp3s, you will hear the poor sound because good music or movies sound sooo much better with these.They also have bigger drivers that require more watts to get normal sound level. So if you again have cheap electronics, you won't get the most out of these. Buy it anyways because it will still sound better than anything else you can get. It will just make you want to upgrade your source. Plus it's great to prevent your kids from damaging their hearing from to high a volume. They'll be able to hear everything more clearly without high volume. So it's a negative if your source is old or weak but a plus otherwise.The manufacturer claims its built like their profession model that sells for around $250 which is highly regarded and wins lots of comparisons. I'd say this m20 is the best you can buy up to that price. My daughter loves it. I find myself sneaking a listen whenever I can even though I have a $2500 audiophile system with large tower speakers. Its very long cord helps and ease of use plugging it into my smartphone or tablet to listen to Pandora or Spotify and enjoy.Build quality is inline with the others at this price. Not stout but durable and functional enough to last a few years at the least.I can't say enough about the value and sound quality. It didn't get 5 stars because none of these under $100 are built to last and could be sturdier. Plus it requires a fair amount of watts for average volume levels. But buy these now, break them in for a couple hours with some constant music playing through it, and enjoy. Buy a bunch for friends and they'll be amazed how much better they are over earbuds, Bluetooth headsets and just about every Beats headsets.","December 8, 2016",AEDIOFS5NXRZT64O3IXJJO2C2F7Q,True,3.0,,Audio-Technica ATH,0.25091331845238096,Positive,0.996,Positive

R2QYNYD6P7YXQT,B00HVLUR18,4.0 out of 5 stars A decent compromise between value and quality.,Terence Wise,4,"These are decent mid-range headphones, which is perfect if that is what you are looking for. Neither superb quality nor bargain basement price, they aim to bridge the two extremes in a Goldilocks fashion. What you are left with is a decent compromise, though slightly below what I'd expected.Value - If you're looking at the M20x instead of the M50, then you're likely concerned about cost to some extent. My pair was bought for roughly 50 dollars, which is fairly reasonable considering that most over-ear models are starting around 100. If this is a bit high for you and sound quality is not that big of a concern, go with a pair of Koss.Build Quality - The parts themselves appear of good quality. Weighty, but not bulky, definitely feels as though it would take some abuse without shattering. Exposed wiring is coated at all points and shows no wearing. The pivoting ability of the ear pieces helps to relieve potential pressure from the connecting piece.Sizing - I have large head, and these fit fine after sliding the ear pieces out a couple of clicks per side. Sliding the ear pieces back works for the smaller heads of some of my friends who have tried them. The fit is not tight, but close enough to take advantage of passive isolation.Isolation - These are not actively noise canceling, so you'll get no where near the isolation of a Bose Quiet Comfort model. However, as with all over-ear headphones, the seal around the ear does impede sound from coming in. These are average to above average for over-ear passive isolation, so if you're in a living room at a holiday while wearing these you'll block out talking and television noises without having to blare your music at high volume. This is a plus for those seeking an immersive experience, but a negative for those needing situational awareness while listening.Sound Quality - The most important characteristic of the headphones. These headphones will give you the fairly flat EQ profile you'd expect from the brand, with the only variance being a slight up-tick in the mids. While bass is strong in these, it is not overpowering to the detriment of other areas of the mix. The clarity is alright, but nothing like the richness of a top-end pair of Boss or Shure, or even the M50s. The highs are not faded and cracking and tin-like, as is the case with other cheaper headphones. The diaphragms in these are large, but they will still provide high quality audio on the power generated by a phone or MP3 player, so there is no need for an amplifier.In all, I'm not returning these and am mostly pleased with the purchase, but I kind of hate that I compromised. I think if these broke I would probably either bite the bullet and buy a Bose QC 30s or the Audio Technica ATH-M50, or I would save the extra money and buy a basic pair of Koss.","September 5, 2015",AFVFQREEW4NL6SH3ON67PYXPMRIA,True,31.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.13770308123249303,Positive,0.4594,Positive

RXV2NJVO6ONNA,B00HVLUR18,4.0 out of 5 stars I was very worried about comfort because I went to best buy and tried on about 20 different kinds of ...,L P,4,"I've had these for a month now, and I've decided to keep them. I was very worried about comfort because I went to best buy and tried on about 20 different kinds of headphones and found them all to be incredibly uncomfortable. You might say I'm a complete baby about how much they squeeze my head. I decided to buy these untested because I really needed some headphones for work.So, I have to say that initially I really hated how tight these were. They have the gorilla squeeze that the whole headphone industry seems to have embraced. (If you manufacturers are reading, please find a way to let us adjust this!) Also, the ear cups are not very deep, so your ear rests against the fabric on the inside of the ear cup (if that makes sense). After listening for an hour or two with them squeezing so hard, my ear was actually embedded in the fabric a bit and it sort of ripped off when I took the headphones off (just like velcro).Haha, like I said, total baby.You might be wondering why I gave this 4 stars with all my complaints. Well, I was able to loosen up the band. I left them stretched out over the armrest of my couch, and bent at the metal inside the head band a bunch. It's very springy, so I was thinking it was a lost cause, but they've finally loosened up and now sit gently over the ears. The sound is very nice and everything about them is sturdy and well built (which is probably why I was able to bend at them so much). The chord even has this ropey quality that helps keep it out of the way (it's not that stiff thin chord you usually see on headphones). So they're perfect for me now, but I took off a star for all the fear I had to go through that I would break them bending at the headband, haha. The band in basically all metal, though, covered by some padding, so it isn't likely to snap, I would think.If you don't like the gorilla squeeze, like me, I wouldn't really recommend these. It's not guaranteed that they're going to loosen up, you know, and it's $50, so it isn't something you really want to experiment with. I may have just gotten lucky.","October 11, 2014",AGHESJ3BSLMT5UM4CXVO22MVT6LA,True,0.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.11753968253968256,Positive,0.9827,Positive

R19D6MRFY8ELNV,B00HVLUR18,4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound doesn't have to be expensive.,Paul,4,"I've used the ATH-M20's before in a professional setting, and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of sound afforded by such inexpensive cans. The ATH-M20x's are very similar; aside from the branding difference, they feel and sound like the same headphones I've used before.+ COMFORT: I use these to monitor myself when narrating audiobooks and for casual listening, and they excel at both. Hours at a stretch, and I don't get ear fatigue.+ SOUND: This is the big point, right? For $50, you can get some damned decent headphones. These will not concuss your ears the way something like Beats will (they're flashy, but far too bottom-heavy); rather, they provide a neutral, accurate representation of what you're listening to. If you're using a computer, you can sculpt the sound via EQ anyway, to achieve the perfect sound for you.+ DURABILITY: The headphones themselves rotate 180 degrees, so if you're mixing in a club or want to hear an accompaniment beside you, you can do so easily. The ear cups feel tough, the cable is strong (and long!), and the headband does not feel flimsy at all.+ ISOLATION: These are not noise-canceling headphones, but they do a very good job of isolating you and the sound source from the world around you.Now for some negatives:- SENSITIVITY: If you're using these with an MP3 player like an iPod or a smart-phone, you might find that the volume doesn't get quite high enough. These are large 40mm drivers, and require a suitable amount of gain to achieve higher volume levels. If you're already listening to loud music like hip-hop or rock, it might not be an issue; but for softer, subtler performances, you may struggle to hear the finer details. Connected to a computer's 3.5mm jack, they sound fine; and if you're using them in conjunction with an audio interface like the Focusrite 2i2, they're plenty loud (although most people won't be doing this, so you can't think of it as an average-use scenario).That's it. The only complaint I have is that they're a little on the quiet side when used with some (again, SOME) consumer-grade electronics. If you're using something like Skullcandy or off-brand headphones that fall apart after a few months, get some ATH-M20x's. They'll last longer than your hearing will and sound good the whole time doing it.","February 21, 2019",AHQI3JNJFJX6IWS7D4UEVNTDYLWQ,True,8.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.19025839793281654,Positive,0.9908,Positive

Out of the box they sounded muffled and distant with no mids and piercing highs but that improved after a couple days. They still favor the highs but the mids showed up and the bass is accurate to low frequencies just remember these are monitors so they won't shake your head although they sound very clean with no distortion even at high volume.They actually sound a lot like my M40X to be honest. They're lighter and don't clamp as hard on the head which I appreciate. The earcups aren't as soft as I remember the new 40s to have been and the cable isn't detachable but they seem high quality for money. I've only had them a week but if they last a while I'll probably change to a 5-star rating.,"December 15, 2022",AFBCWIGXUBMLSFOFG7AGPMCJHPWQ,True,1.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.14765454545454548,Positive,0.9838,Positive

I am also very familiar with the ATH-M50's which I already own as well.These are impressive! They have that same wonderful sound signature of the ATH-M50's (though not quite as good) but at much lower cost. You get the great detail, clarity and imagery that the ATH-M50's are known for.In my video review I cover:1. Why these make great DJ headphones2. Durability & Build Quality3. Comfort4. Sound QualityIf you want to see the sound leak test then refer to my original YouTube video [...] as I wasn't able to keep the full length here.One thing to note is that these have a straight cable whereas the previous model (ATH-M20) has a coiled cable. Also the ATH-M20x is lighter at 190 grams compared to the previous version the ATH-M20 which is 320 grams. It's very comfortable to wear these headphones whether around your neck or on you head. The fact that they're lighter then the previous version makes them that much better in my opinion :)These are the perfect budget friendly pair of headphones.

They are NOT the most focused or best sounding cans--but for under 50 bucks, they are pretty damn good. I use them for podcasting and critical music mixing. Again, for audiophile ears, you you'd probably do better with GRADO SR60's (around $65)--but when sound isolation (not noise cancelling) is a must, I found myself impressed.If you are a professional recording engineer, you should be able to afford $300+ cans that are noticeably superior--but for the rest of us, these ATH-M20X Headphones are more than adequate for ""studio work.""","July 14, 2022",AEF7NQPQQX34TMUT54BWZ34YOLSQ,True,4.0,Pattern Name: HeadphonesStyle: Wired,Audio-Technica ATH,0.2668055555555556,Positive,0.9627,Positive
R1M1ZIK6WZ8AIK,B0D95134GD,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Low cost AirPods Max alternative! A classic revisited!,Mahajo,5,"My earliest forays into a More expensive headphone was with the Beats Brand and the wired Beats Pro headphones. Then I graduated to the wireless Beats Studios, as well as the Executive headphones and those were my headphones for years. I don’t recall the noise cancelling being anything at all and of course there was no such thing as a transparency mode back then, but at the time I loved the look, the colors (especially metallic gold of the Beats Studios) and enjoyed the heavy bass sound they provided. As I grew more sophisticated and appreciated more sound quality, I moved on to other headphones (plus my last pair of Beats Studio the hinge broke on one side). I had tried the Beats Solo Pros and wanted to love them but they were, though improved, still an on-ear headphone and too uncomfortable for me. I had hoped then that an update for the Studios to Studio Pros was imminent but turned out it would be awhile before this did come to pass but I knew once it did I would have to buy them and try them out eventually. It didn’t take long as I saw they went on sale for $100 off only a month after release and I jumped on that deal! I am pleasantly impressed for the most part. They do a lot of the same things as the AirPods Max, if not as well. Sound quality is really good and has a more neutral sound than previous Beats Studios did. The Dolby Atmos with head tracking is fun. They are a little bright sounding and I sometimes have to either turn down the volume or use the eq on the iPhone Music App to lower the treble, or turn off the Spatial Stereo feature in the control center, (long press on the volume slider) but overall I find the sound pleasant and lively. There are no wear sensors, but I love the old school B buttons for pausing, volume and skipping and rewinding tracks very easy and intuitive after using Beats Studios for years so I don’t really miss it that much frankly. They are fairly comfortable, the cushioning on the ear pads and headband are plush but they do have a strong clamping force which might bother some but doesn’t bother me overly much, and I am fan of how stable they feel on my head. Noise canceling is quite good but as is expected not at AirPods Max level. I’ve always loved the 5 LED lights on the bottoms of the right ear cup which will show you the battery level when pressed. A double press of this button will switch between ANC and Transparency. Long press for Bluetooth pairing. No auto-switching between devices but once connected to a device in your iCloud, they automatically show up in other devices in the cloud and a press within the Bluetooth’s settings will switch it to the other device quickly and easily. The headphones will announce messages and you have the ability to use “Hey, Siri’ but I’ve noticed sometimes audio will stop with an announcement or Siri activation and may not continue playing music on its own, but a simple press of the “B” button will start play again. On the AirPods Max audio will reduce significantly but not stop, but with these the sound stops abruptly which can be jarring at first when the announcement is made. Of course you can turn off announcements in the control center if you want to avoid the interruption altogether. Build quality is plastic but still solid with metal sliders that have a jarring but somehow pleasing click as you slide them in or out. They are also very light, certainly lighter than the AirPods Max (which I also own). Also the case is nice with a spot for cables and even another pouch inside on the other side if you need it, but can’t really imagine adding much as with the headphones in, there really isn’t a lot of room. If you can get these on sale especially I would recommend then as a less pricey alternative to the more expensive headphones like the AirPods Max. I’m a fan of the sandstone color, I hear the dark colors, especially black, are finger smear magnets. These are a little bit like that, but with the light color it is much less of an issue. These are a classic revisited and I will always have a soft spot for the Beats Studio (now pros) headphones! I forgot to mention that you can use the usb c cable for lossless audio from your computer or iPad, which is awesome, although i have yet to try that out as I am all about wireless functionality, I don’t like being tied down to wires! Still great option, and one the AirPods Max cannot do (yet anyway). These are a great option for those not willing or able to spend more and still great a great headphone!","September 11, 2023",AGUIQ5S5JSDEN4XKQGG5JPZZQNHQ,True,446.0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.23130498533724342,Positive,0.9993,Positive
R1MZVYL3ULXVYC,B0D95134GD,"5.0 out of 5 stars The King is back, for a niche audience",Apple nerd,5,"I loved my Beats Solo headphones as a teenager. I’m talking monster cable beats. Nothing was cooler, the bass was thundering, and while it didn’t sound great, it sounded so much better than the iPod in ears or my dad’s old crappy walkman on-ears I was used to. I listen to mostly electronic music, bass/dubstep, house & techno, all of that with some hip/hop and pop sprinkled in as well. I also love movies.As an adult at home, I have my beyerdynamic dt 770 pros for mixing and editing with. I have a pair of AirPods Pro 2s for travel and day to day usage. Recently, I have started to work from home a lot more in meetings, and there has been a lot of construction outside my window, and I hate having things stuck in my ears for hours on end so I was in the market for a pair of noise canceling over ear headphones.My partner has a pair of AirPods Max, I found the sound to be really great, detailed with good sound stage and flat great for voice but clinical and safe in all respects and lacking the bass I was looking for. Even with the top-of-the-pack anc and apple integration features I was used to on my in-ears I never could swallow the price. Also they were comfortable, but so heavy and not suited for long periods of wear. And the case was weird.So I tried the bereydynamic lagoon ANCs. They were garbage. Impossible to use the controls and pair with devices, sounded really good but not as good as I would expect from this brand, and the issues go on and on. They did have good bass, but the anc barely worked. I liked them at a lot at first, but they fell apart so quickly.Then I saw that apple had brand new beats headphones, and were 30% off on Amazon. I had to try them, the nostalgia hit hard and I’m so happy they didn’t change the iconic design from the studio 2s which I also liked as a replacement for my solos. I. Am. Floored. Super lightweight yet feel very solid and no creaking, apple integration features (i consider no auto switching to be a plus tbh, but icloud pairing is a must. Works very well with Apple TV), but the sound! Is so FUN. It’s like I’m in a concert hall with huge racks of speakers and towers of subwoofers. So much better than my old beats, by a landslide. Great instrument separation, and decent soundstage, sounds less like a wall of sound like my pro 2s do but not as wide and spatial as the max. A little bright for my taste, but never enough to cause fatigue. None of them come close to the 770s of course - would I recommend these for classical? Or acoustic? Never. Or for any type actual professional work? No. But if you like electronic, you will have so much fun enjoying music with these. The ANC and transparency is very very good, identical to my AirPods Pro, I would argue maybe even better than the max in some situations. The mic quality is good, not as good as my AirPods but good enough for work calls. I also love watching movies, and having multi-channel support like my pro 2s is epic. I absolutely love these - and am so happy I got them!","September 7, 2023",AEUHSKBV2ADJTTXVB55RN7UQQZTA,True,449.0027,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.31172266139657445,Positive,0.9994,Positive

My headphones came out of the box with about 56% battery and though I just received them yesterday, after a good amount of use so far I haven't had to charge them yet, and probably won't have to for about a week.- Noise cancellation is excellent for my expectations/standards. I've read reviews saying they're not that great; I say if you're super-duper picky about this, and you're looking for absolutely NO outside sound at ALL, then yeah, maybe these aren't for you. I don't listen to music or audio very loud as I have sensitive hearing, so with noise cancellation active I can still hear small/faint muffled sounds in my surroundings (with audio paused/turned off): someone vacuuming, a thud from someone dropping something heavy upstairs, group laughter or yelling (if it's nearby). But overall, the ANC is certainly very good. With audio playing I really can't hear any of these things, except a faint hum of a very loud machine or my fiance, if he's next to me (he has a loud voice), but even then his voice is muffled and I can't make out every word unless he's yelling or shrieking.- Love transparency mode. Perfect blend of audio + surroundings.Cons:- While headband is cushioned and fairly comfortable for a short period of time, I do begin to feel a small ache at the top of my head after about 30 minutes of use. I have a small head, so I can adjust the headband slightly forward or back to remedy this, but I do find myself having to shift them every 20 to 30 minutes due to slight discomfort.- I'm not sure if this is something standard or not, but when plugged in to my computer with the basic audio cable, I cannot use the left ear controls to pause or adjust the audio volume; they only work in wireless/Bluetooth mode, or with the USB-C cable. The right ear transparency/noise cancellation mode button, however, does work regardless of how you're listening (wired or wireless).Overall I really like these headphones, and I'm happy I purchased them for the $169 sale price via Prime Day. I expect to get a lot of use out of them, and hope they'll last me several years as a reliable pair of quality headphones. I would recommend these if you're looking for good quality that may not be top dollar, but relatively close.","July 22, 2024",AFRRVTXY3LHOL5AJIPCUWW7QEJAQ,True,10.0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.23107609710550886,Positive,0.9974,Positive
R3H7Z64KP0058Z,B0D95134GD,5.0 out of 5 stars Love them,Kage1218,5,"I was so happy to find these at such a deal (almost $200 off). I have really been wanting this type of head phone instead of my AirPods as, while I love them for separate reasons, they just don’t do music justice with how it play/relays to you and can’t ever get that volume to bump. I like the sound quality of the beats, the different settings, they are comfortable and don’t feel like you’re wearing earmuffs (my concern going from AirPods to these). The colors and finish are gorgeous and they are soft to the touch. Set up was the simplest tech product I have set up in a while. My only warning for those with longer hair, if you’re wearing them around your neck (to hear something, talk with someone, etc.) careful taking them off or putting them back on your ears, there is a small gap between the headphone part with the buttons (has the b on it) and it’s small enough to snag your hair and pull it out if you move quick without knowing. While this isn’t how they are shown to wear, it’s a comfortable way to wear while listening to. Just do so at your own risk of losing some strands of hair. I still give it 5/5 as I am more impressed with this than I expected and have been with quality sound in headphones in a while. Also, charge lasts good and it does not take long to fully charge either. The lights that show the battery level when you turn them on helps because if you see it’s at 3 when you turn on for an hour or so, you can charge when finished. I have yet to have the battery die on me and I’ve had them for a month now.","July 16, 2024",AHC3ZOZMMPM4ILB57DTY3LWLUPUQ,True,22.0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.2618055555555556,Positive,0.9792,Positive

The build quality is top-notch, and these headphones are clearly designed to withstand regular use without any issues. They can truly take a beating and keep performing at their best.The audio quality is crisp and clear, delivering a rich and immersive listening experience. Whether I'm watching movies, TV shows, or just listening to music, the sound is consistently impressive.One of the highlights for me was how seamlessly these headphones connected to my Apple TV. Despite my Apple TV being locked inside a wooden console, the connection was effortless and stable, allowing me to enjoy my content without any interruptions. The noise-canceling feature is superb; even when my family is noisily going about their activities, I can immerse myself in what I'm watching without any distractions. It’s a game-changer for anyone who wants to enjoy their shows or movies in peace and quiet.Overall, the Beats Studio Pro headphones are a fantastic investment. They deliver outstanding audio quality, robust durability, and an easy, hassle-free connection to devices. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for high-quality wireless headphones that offer excellent noise cancellation.","August 17, 2024",AF2RNJTQTO42HDDNLU2O2OAD45IQ,True,1.0,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.3534166666666667,Positive,0.9926,Positive

The noise reduction helped keep my sanity. Unfortunately, the work laptop would not recognize the microphone, but my cellphone does.Having the audio cable for my personal laptop helped me join meetings and easily hear everyone despite the remodel noise. The music reproduction is not true and natural like Sony professional headphones. Therefore, listening to classical music is a bit off but not horrible.

I love them so much that I’ve basically turned into Beats Santa, handing out pairs to my friends and family for every Christmas and birthday. Why? Because everyone deserves to experience this level of audio bliss!Let’s talk about the battery life—chef’s kiss! I’ve got 18-hour days, and my Beats are right there with me from dawn to way past dusk, never missing a beat (pun totally intended). Whether I'm blasting music while working or zoning out with an audiobook, these bad boys keep going. And let me tell you, the sound quality is so crystal clear, I can practically hear which band member skipped rehearsal. I’m out here like, “Who let you in the studio with that half-baked performance?”And don’t get me started on phone calls. My voice comes through so clear that folks think I’m standing next to them, and no one outside my bubble can hear a thing. So, if you’re having “top secret” convos or planning your next great escape, you’re safe with Beats. Nobody's eavesdropping on your business!Now, for my fellow noise-cancellation lovers—these things are like magic. I pop them on when I’m diving into an audiobook and BOOM, I’m in another universe. But listen, word of advice: be aware of your surroundings. I nearly karate chopped a friend who snuck up on me while I was deep in the plot of some thriller. Sorry, not sorry—it was an automatic reflex!And the seamless pairing? Chef's kiss again! These Beats slide into my Apple ecosystem smoother than butter. My iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air all link up without a hitch. Even during Zoom meetings, my co-workers hear me loud and clear, which means these headphones pull double duty for both work and play.Haven’t tested them out in the gym yet, but a few of my friends swear by them for their workouts and runs—no slipping, no fuss, just solid beats to keep them going. Bottom line? These headphones are an all-around win. If you’re still on the fence, it’s time to jump over.

R2UXJLAZR33T40,B0D95134GD,4.0 out of 5 stars Same Headphones for same price at Apple; Purchase AppleCare Plus for $29 from Apple,Amazon Customer,4,"I love my new Beats. I gave it four stars because I keep getting disconnected from my phone. I will update the rating if I figure out why and can correct the dropped calls. I will contact Apple support when I get a chance.This review is being written regarding AppleCare Plus. Huge suggestion: Buy AppleCare Plus directly from Apple for $29. Save yourself the hassle! Also, I recommend checking the price. I just purchase the Beats Studio Pro from Amazon for $179. Regular price was $349. Apple is also selling them for $179 as today, 6/16/24. I'm writing this long review I. Case it helps in regards to purchasing protection. I wanted to understand why AppleCare Plus was rate 4 stars instead of 5. I've had it and have it for several products and have always been highly satisfied. After reading nearly all of the 1-star reviews, the same message stood out- DO NOT PURCHASE APPLECARE PLUS FROM AMAZON. I decided to forgo reading the 5-star messages from approximately 64% of the customers, and just heed the message to purchase directly from Apple. Below is my experience in doing so. Again, to be fair, I cannot review the process for purchasing this plan through Amazon because I did not do so -I just wanted to avoid any hassle.I spoke with 3 different people from Apple's support team- one person via chat and two people on a phone call. All three people were extremely helpful, friendly, and made sure they did everything to help. It took nearly 45 minutes to purchase because the problem was my purchase date showed up as April 15, 2024 versus the true purchase date June 14th, 2024. The chat agency tried to change the date and it took down. Despite her efforts she was unable to change the date on her end so arrange to have someone call. A support person called, I missed the first call somehow,contacted the old chat message asking for a new call time. The support agent happened to called back anyways and the chat agent had also arranged a new call. So helpful on both ends. After speaking with the support person, he had to get additional help because again, the purchase date was not showing up. The last young lady I spoke to was able to work magic on her end and set it up where I was finally able to purchase AppleCare Plus for $29. I am highly satisfied with the support I received from Apple and I have peace of mind knowing my headphones are protected for 2 years! Next time, I will purchase products directly from Apple if the price is pretty much the same. This way, I can easily add AppleCare Plus! Had I checked before hand, I would have seen that Apple was offering the headphones for the exact same price as Amazon.","June 15, 2024",AEL3YFH2XJPGWP5J3F4I2KFB5KCA,True,2.0,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.1711300505050505,Positive,0.9969,Positive
R1VSABWBIXFJZI,B0D95134GD,3.0 out of 5 stars Overall: Disappointing,Captain Geektoid,3,"Long story short:Not what I was expecting, and returning.Long Story long:So Last year my Fiance gifted me Beats Solo3 for my B-Day. I'm someone who loves to listen to music, and had been looking for some new headphones that would accompany a pair of Monster - Inspirations I've had for the past 10 years that are still going strong. Monster, you might remember, was the first company to produce Beats before they were bought by Apple. The Solo3's were PERFECT. I know they're not the most ""Audiophile"" pair of cans on the planet, but even Sennheiser's HD 800's need some sort of DAC to make them less...Flat sounding. And hey, if you like Flat and consider yourself a true audiophile...well first, I don't know why you'd be reading a review for Beats Studio Pro, and second, I mean good for you, listening to music like it was a 1920's Phonograph.Me, I personally favor boosted everything. Bass, Mids, Highs. And the Solo 3's were, hell, still are, amazing. No full DAC required. Everytime I plug in the 3.5mm cable and listen to Lossless audio on my home server, Gosh, I mean...they sound good streaming 320kbps AAC/MP3's over bluetooth, which is what MOST OF YOU will use them for, but LOSSLESS!? It makes me wet. I'm sorry.So enter the Studio Pro's. Got these for $169 on Prime Day. Busted these babies out, put them in AAANNND...boy, they are not like the Solo3's at all. I mean, connected via Bluetooth is fine. It's fine. They're fine. Any $75 dollar headset will perform well enough over bluetooth and give you comparable noise cancelling if you're looking for that. But these, at retail NOT ON SALE, are like $350...I expect MORE from that. The other reviews gushing about these led me to believe I'd be getting MORE from that. And, again, they're fine. It's fine. But not GREAT. And for $350 I expect them to be great. For $170 I expected them to be BETTER, and they just weren't. And that's just bluetooth...when I plugged them in via the USB-C cable AND the 3.5mm jack for lossless audio...boy the performance was not there. They were so much quieter than the Solo's, and nothing was as Punchy. In fact, they sounded kind of flat. But if I wanted flat, I'd get the Sennheiser's and like a $600 DAC or other sound mix board to plug directly into. And you know, I have a DAC. It's the $65 dollar Fiio BTR3K, which is actually a very nice portable device I've used with my Solo3's and in my car to get lossless audio in my car. It performs well for what it is. So I plugged the Studio Pro's into it and they instantly sounded superior. And, y'know, I probably wouldn't mind that at all if I was listening to music 8 hours a day through the DAC and with the headphones firmly on. But I'm not, at least not enough to justify even the heavily discounted price I paid. And even with the Dac and settings, they still weren't as punchy. The Solo3's...I don't know, everytime I listen to lossless, it feels like I'm in the studio with the band, but with the Studio Pros, it feels like I'm listening to an MP3 on an iPod from 2008. That you downloaded. From Limewire. I mean, again, it's FINE, they're FINE. But shouldn't we be expecting more than FINE? Maybe it's time to bite the bullet and just invest in a Pair of the Sony XM5's or, yes, the Sennheiser HD600's or 700's or 800's with a beefy Desktop DAC if I want to increase my experience.But these...these ain't it. (Side note: They're VERY comfortable, and if Comfort is what you're after, and only comfort, you'll love these.)","July 20, 2024",AEMWNOMHJCIKJIJK354SLZ7QZISQ,True,4.0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.223175505050505,Positive,0.9988,Positive
R2FK6YBRHFTCMK,B0D95134GD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Arguably as good or better than AirPods Pro Max for WAY less money, and USB-C",Tim Page,5,"These are not the overpriced, boomy, distorted Beats of the early 2000s. Ever since Apple acquired them, Beats has been making products that rival or surpass Apple's own at lower prices, and its like people haven't noticed. I have a pair of the AirPods Pro Max that my wife likes to borrow, as well as the older Beats Studio with the hated Micro USB port, which I actually find more comfortable to wear, especially if casually walking around or lying on the couch, but doesn't sound *quite* as good-- still respectable, but in a wired desk situation I still prefer my Sony MDR7506s on *well* mastered music (they're built for monitoring, so if a recording sounds bad, they're supposed to make you notice, ideally so you can fix it). So, when I saw this on a Prime Day sale I jumped at it. This pair of Beats uses USB-C to charge like every modern device *should* do, is just as lightweight and comfortable as the old ones, sounds noticeably better (I believe they upgraded the drivers and also learned some fancy new DSP tricks over the last few years), especially in the detail and control-- seriously, sound is subjective, but to me they sound at least 95% as good as the AirPods Pro Max and up there with a pair of Sennheiser HD650s I used to own that unfortunately got stolen (also, those were wired and open-backed, so not really a fair comparison, especially in the convenience and portability department). They also have all of the cool whiz-bang features of the more expensive AirPods (anc, transparency, surround, find my, easy pairing and switching). Unless and until Apple comes out with a new improved AirPod Pro Max equivalent that addresses the ergonomic shortcomings of the original (namely lightning charger, weight, balance, and clamping) I think these are the new king.","July 26, 2024",AEAQHGLXYFP57C3J5S6ZIK42NNOQ,True,2.0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.14400252525252527,Positive,0.9634,Positive
R1525LERAB07PI,B0D95134GD,4.0 out of 5 stars NO-ise cancellation,Bryce Underwood,4,"I have wanted a nice quality pair of over the ear headphones for quite some time now. During prime day, I saw these and decided it was worth a shot. The sound quality is really great, and the transparency mode is very clear. I am able to listen to music or my books while being able to have a conversation with family, and have complete awareness. They are quite comfortable and light as well, and I love the case! I have large ears, so they do ""stuff"" into these shallow cups. I have felt this with a lot of models I have tried on, so I wont give that against these. The only competitor that did great for size was the Apple Airpods Max, but I have not seen the best reviews on those for their price tag.But when using noise cancellation, I am very underwhelmed by it. During testing, I was on my back patio. I live on 1 acre lots, with the neighbors patio being a decent distance away. With no music on, i could hear them talking, as well as the quiet hum of the freeway that is over a mile away. I could hear my dog's nails on the concrete as they walked as well. I understand that not all ANC is meant to completely rid every noise, but I almost feel as if I should save the battery and use the mode as ""off"" with no ANC enabled. You hear more for sure, but in times I want that enabled I would rather hear next to nothing. This was with no hat or glasses on, with as much seal around my ear as possible.If ANC isn't your priority, the sound is amazing. I love the compatibility of it with my iPhone, and for the sale price I will be happy with these. I only hope as I travel on planes, the ANC will provide some help with the noise.","July 22, 2024",AHAOBBCAVRBLJFHZK5L2XDEDEBWQ,True,0.0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.3340307088744589,Positive,0.991,Positive
R3SZUAME1IDBNG,B0D95134GD,4.0 out of 5 stars Defective + Update,MJ,4,"I was disappointed. I received these with the speakers already blown right out of the box. They sounded like torn paper. I love Beats so I didn't understand this. I missed the return window by only one day. So I chatted with Amazon Customer Service and they issued me a refund so I can order another pair. Just wanted a replacement pair, but I will order again with the refund. Can't comment on sound quality or anything until I get my new pair. 😞Update: Amazon customer service was amazing!! Turns out that my headphones were defective when the item was received and checked. Amazon sent me the refund and I was able to buy a new pair. I am in love with the easy connection and sound. These are not audiophile type headphones, but they're great for everyday use. They do sound better on an iPhone. I tried them with my Android and though I can get Dolby Sound, the fullness just wasn't there, even with the phone's EQ. You can't use these on a device that has no sound settings, it will be horrible. That's the sacrifice when Apple took over. But on my iPhone, I set the EQ that Spotify has (if you know how to get to it), and wow! I was able to get all of the sound, including the bass I was looking for. Yes, Apple has taken away the muffled hard bass that Beats is known for and balanced it out. The EQ gives these a better and full sound. I use these with Transparency turned on and they sound just as good. ANC isn't the best but it does a decent job on the plane for me. Battery life? OMG! I only charge once every two weeks as I only use them for about 4 hours a day or so. Don't leave them charging, as with any battery, it will reduce the life of the battery. I am so happy I didn't give up on these. I traded in the black for the sandstone color and bought custom ear cushions for that original look.

R3JCLZ544P4Z3M,B0D95134GD,4.0 out of 5 stars Brown Beats for a Brown Girl😝,Q,4,"I’ve been waiting for these to come back because I loved the colors so much. Also my Studio 3s broke/broke like cracked at both ears this year and I’ve had them since 2019. I was totally devastated and I didn’t trust online sellers so I gave up getting new ones. While I wish this is part of the regular colors I’m glad this collection came back.Initially the Beats were not loud enough (50% was a whisper) and I was disappointed until I saw a Reddit thread stating to restart your phone. Now they are the right volume.Pros: 1. comfortable (ears are less plush than my Studio3s but I’m satisfied), 2. cute color, 3. good volume, 4 ability to switch between ANC & transparency, 5. The case has pockets for the cords and one zips. Great for storing everything without it falling out. 6. Additionally as a corporate girly people are less likely to talk to you when they can see the headphones. (I will put these on instead of the AirPods so I can be left alone😅) (these arrived overnight so I am currently testing at work and I have not been bothered yet)Cons: 1. Not the easiest to get in and out the case. I can see that causing wear and tear on the headphones long term. 2. Also the case is soft which it’s cute but I’m wondering how it will protect the headphones long term or thrown in a bag with other items. 3. ANC is not as great as my old Studio 3. (This can be how I hear them but I don’t think they block sounds as well) 4. Bass is not as great as my Studio 3 but I’m satisfied without the boom boom boom.Overall great purchase and I caught them when they re-released on sale. So can’t beat the $277 plus tax. Less than $300 is a decent discount.","August 16, 2024",AGRQRB7R5A5SS64E2NTCD4JQCQFA,True,85.0,Color: EarthStyle: Studio ProSet: With AppleCare+ (2 Years),Beats Studio Pro,0.19467841682127393,Positive,0.9446,Positive
R3REKPIFS6TC75,B0D95134GD,4.0 out of 5 stars Review And Comparison To The Sennheiser Momentum 4,vladislav grutsenko,4,"Highs: Beats > Sennheiser.High frequencies are good in both headphones, but Sennheiser has them more emphasized. Sometimes it feels like if you crank them slightly higher you're gona hear sibilants. It's on the edge and this is not the most pleasant edge to me. However, the sound is accurate and somewhat distinctive in the upper-frequency range for the Sennheiser. As for the Beats, highs are as detailed as on the Sennheiser (if not more) but not overemphasized.Mids: Beats > Sennheiser.Sennheisers have a so-called v-shaped sound profile so it feels like Beats have way more mids. It might be even too much at first, but you get used to it. Beats are more detailed and fast. Sennheiser feels muddy in comparison (but still very precise and detailed compared to Sony and Bose). I think it's partially because of overemphasized bass that brings distortion into the mid range. You start hearing things that were not originally intended to be there by artists. Because of this, Sennheiser sounds more ""musical"", it fills the voids between the instruments and produces an overall ""dense"" sound. And the Beats have more reference sound. For many instrumental tracks (rock, metal) Beats might sound boring and hollow. I can't blame the headphones because such music is usually mastered to sound good on consumer electronics. And you can't put good ""dense"" sound into an average stereo system. It will sound too muddy and.. just bad. So they leave the voids between the instruments and try to separate them. But on a reference headphone, this sounds... well... too reference :)Electronic music is a completely different story, this is where Beats shine! Electronic sounds are way more precise. And with Beats, you get this precision (especially in the complicated EDM tracks; I mostly listened to psytrance, psychill, idm, etc. But an average techno/trance sounds good as well). Sennheisers sound fine too, but only until you compare them with Beats.Bass: Sennheiser > Beats.The Beats are precise, again, and so is the bass. If the bass was intended in the music that you listen to - you will hear it. And you will hear exactly as much as it was planned by an artist. Rap songs sound great because of that, as well as some EDM tracks with massive sub-bass. As for the Sennheisers, well, they are v-shaped still so they add a subtle amount of bass to the overall mix, and in most cases, this sounds fine and even fun. It also comes without surprise that in bass-heavy rap songs, it starts to sound too overemphasized. In terms of precision, Sennheisers are not as precise but still hold their ground well against sony/bose/etc.Soundstage: Sennheiser > Beats.Soundstage feels subtly more open on the Sennheisers. Probably this is because they are not as precise and produce more ""parasite"" harmonics that make instruments sound further from your head. I like this effect but this makes me wonder if it's possible to achieve a good soundstage for closed headphones without compromising the sound speed and precision.ANC/Transparency: Beats > Sennheiser.Beats are slightly better in noise cancellation and noticeably better in transparency mode. Not as good as AirPods Max, but kinda close. Sennheiser is not bad though, it's just not as good. Wind can be a problem for both headphones, but I don't care. Beats are better at blocking fan noise but may overemphasize it in the transparency mode.Mic: Sennheiser >> Beats.Sennheiser microphones are superior both in terms of volume and quality. Beats is really mediocre, on the edge of what I would call ""usable"" for the zoom meetings. On top of that Beats mic sounds really quiet in Windows 11 rendering itself useless. I hope new firmware/drivers will fix that.Ergonomics: Sennheiser > Beats.I like Sennheiser more. Beats have smaller earcups with stiffer ear cushions. Also, the clamping force on my average-sized head is obnoxiously strong. Not to the point when I feel a headache after wearing them for a few hours but still too much in my opinion. However, I like the fact that Beats are more compact. It makes a difference when I listen to them in bed, for example. They don't rub as much against the pillow and don't produce a lot of noise like Sennheisers.Sennheiser ear cups are rotating 180 degrees when on the Beats, they barely move. This is important if you want to move one headphone back to open your ear when you need to listen to somebody or something from the outside world quickly. Or if you're a DJ and need to hear monitors with one of your ears :). Sennheiser earcups pivot and stay perfectly adjacent to your head, unlike the Beats.Connectivity: Beats > Sennheiser.Both headphones are ok when you're near the source, but the Beats stay connected longer as I walk away from it. The usable distance is like ~30% longer. They also perform better for a source behind a wire mesh or a security door. I know that Sennheiser is capable of working with 2 devices simultaneously and this works pretty well. Not sure about the Beats but I don't really care...Controls: Beats >> Sennheiser.Beats are very basic. They don't even have a head detection. And this feels soo good after the glitchy Sennheisers! You can read more details in other Sennheiser reviews, but they are really bad in that aspect. I bit the bullet and used them as my daily drivers, and oh boy... settings were getting changed randomly, I had tons of fantom head detection events, and when I wanted to put them on or off I almost always accidentally touched the right earcup sensor and triggered something (usually play/pause).","July 22, 2023",AHW6Y7QXQTDZZQHKFGWJCKTN66BA,True,283.0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.2211122142320489,Positive,0.9981,Positive
R1A071BB16BX5M,B0D95134GD,5.0 out of 5 stars Everything I Was Expecting,Eric,5,"Didn't read a lot of reviews for this unit, but according to my son one of the big drawbacks was the smaller ear cups. Have 2 of the Beats 3 units and bought this to replace one if them after I convinced my wife to try the Beats3 out. The Pro version is nice. A little odd you have to install the pro software for an Android phone, but it really wasn't that bad or intrusive. The sound is nice. The noise canceling is definitely better than the studio3 version. I can see where larger heads or ears will have issues, but for ""normal"" heads this is really nice. haven't had it long enough to judge the battery life, but I'd it's anything like the studio 3, it's awesome. Oh by the way, the sound quality as a wireless headset for phone calls is great according to my son. Overall, I would highly recommend these if you have a ""normal"" size head and ears.","August 24, 2024",AHX7UIVA7YVI4FQEHVDCBUFQN5UA,True,0.0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.21218253968253972,Positive,0.9927,Positive
R234Y6Y9SN7RW7,B0D95134GD,4.0 out of 5 stars Honest Review,emmy,4,"I'll give it to you straight, as a broke college student i would NOT pay full price for these. I got them for 51% off which is a much more fair cost in my opinion.I've been wanting some good noise canceling headphones for some time now and I finally settled on spending a little more than I typically would on headphones on these.The headphones themself look very nice looks wise, I got the brown version and im very happy with the color. Id say they are a little tight on my head which gave me a little bit of a headache after short use but at least you know they wont slip.I got the app that comes with the headphones (see QR code in box) and I'd say getting the app is a MUST for full, easy function. On the app youre able to do things such as name your headphones, locate them (if lost), use noise canceling settings, etc.The noise canceling itself is the main reason I bought these. Id rate that feature a 2.5-3/5. When I turn on the feature in my app it blocked out the noise of my fan but not the TV or talking around me. It seems to only 100% block out smaller noises and quiet down the louder ones. The louder noice is significantly reduced but you can for sure still hear.In all, if you want to get these headphones, I would for sure say to wait for them to go on sale. I believe I got mine for ~180. Like I said I would NOT pay full price on these, save the money for a better usage.","July 17, 2024",AGFN7BROHOLVJARFKJQUZOHLN7SA,True,1.0,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.24973246287762416,Positive,0.9791,Positive

I Love the transparent mode so he can hear everything while listening to his music cuz it annoys me when im calling him and he ""didn't hear me"". It doesnt come with a base to charge it just the cord. So he uses my lightening fast charger base. He Loves the battery life on its great. Wish there were some cool colors like dark purple or cool designs. They case is soft, which is good for carrying around but I kept the hard case it comes in case we travel and pack it in a suitcase just in case.

The sound on these is amazing, and I bought them ONLY for sitting and listening to lossless/Atmos music. I am not a gamer. But I have a long, narrow head and while the sound was terrific, these are being returned because they’re not adjustable and they don’t fit my narrow head. The around the ear cups on me seem to “droop” and sat lower on my ears and didn’t deliver the sound right into my ear canal. Such a shame, I really wanted to keep these.

They are amazing, however wearing them for longer than 6 hours begins to hurt. I've never had any issues with these, considering they aren't squeezing my head. This has been an amazing change. I have a smaller head, and they fit well.The noise cancellation works well at the gym, however I've experienced some issues if the people workout around me hit the spots that the cancellation doesn't cover. It's rare, but it does happen. The headphones seem to block out sounds from directly to your sides rather than behind and to the side of you.The battery life has lasted just as long as the beats 3. They are definitely the better version of the beats 3. I would say my only complaint is the color options. I was hoping for a nice grey, but not everything comes in grey.The charging cable is a c cable, and they charge relatively quickly.4.7/5 for me","August 9, 2024",AEPU53FPLT7Z2XENLWDCGR6H4UXQ,True,11.0,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.18235294117647063,Positive,0.9331,Positive

I gravitated towards the Beats Pro because they are easy to store away due to them being collapsible. I love the brown color and how sleek and minimal it looks.

R3RSUGFYRCGKOF,B0D95134GD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound, Good Quality.",Spazzola,5,"Well, after having lost one of my AirPods (gen3) and not being able to justify purchasing a replacement left pod for $90, I started doing research.I came across these beats studio pros and looked at their stats. 40 hours of play time? Probably the most enticing thing about them to me. Then came the active noise cancellation, and spatialized audio. ANC intrigued me. I wanted it to be better than the AirPods at cutting out sound. While I was looking into these I happened to be doing it during Black Friday deals. Which meant I thought they were $170, which was the price of brand new AirPods. Then I saw their original price of $350. Which enticed me even more in a way, thinking of the price tag fallacy, higher price must mean quality. I mulled this over and over and eventually ended up missing the half off sale. Then I knew I wanted these babies. I watched and waited for a sale to come up again. I was not willing to pay $350 for wireless headphones, as I am not willing to pay $350 on just about anything, but thats just me. For me, $179 is splurging significantly. I caught another sale. I bought them and hoped for the best.I will have to be honest in saying I was hesitant to stray from AirPods and move over to headphones. The less I have on me the better, so having something sit in my ear rather than over my head appeals to me. But having my device constantly slip out of my ear or feel unsecured was not enjoyable. That’s how I lost my left AirPod in the first place. These headphones feel sturdy for me. I was pleasantly surprised. Although I still did not particularly care for a bulkier heavier device, I did appreciate their securedness. They do eventually make my ears sore but I usually just adjust them. I will not count this against them because every pair of headphones I have ever owned eventually made my ears hurt or gave me a headache. Im sensitive what can I say? The padding on the top band that goes over your head was a nice touch.The ANC is powerful. I loved being immersed in my music. I have no complaints really.Spatial Audio… I personally could care less about it, so I don’t have much to say about it. I just don’t use it as a personal choice, not saying it isn’t good.The sound quality seems adequate to me.The volume is pretty great, I never have to have it all the way up to get clear sounding audio or to feel like I can actually hear something. Which with my AirPods was a constant problem.The mic on these, I am thoroughly impressed with. Compared to my AirPods, its like award winning lol. People on calls usually can’t tell I am using a headset at all.I’m not sure how long it truly takes to charge them, as I haven’t charged them from dead to full yet. I imagine from the little bit of charging I did do when they first arrived they will take a little bit, but to me it’s worth it.Overall, I feel my money was well spent on a good product. I got a better bang for my buck with these beats than I did with my airpods. The compactness of AirPods are nice, and I like a compact item so having a larger device is something to get used to but I still think it’s worth it.","January 15, 2024",AFGMDHUXSF76BWEEVF5IAL7E6NKQ,True,82.0,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.17094941348973608,Positive,0.9965,Positive
RDHOFA7MKRYPL,B0D95134GD,5.0 out of 5 stars THEY DESERVE NEGATIVE STARS,Warning Please Read!!!,5,"Please read this review if you are thinking of buying g these headphones!!!!! They are on sale for a reason, and it’s not because they are good or even meh. I compared them to my old Studio 2’s from 2013 (11 years old) and they are horribly different.I had high hopes for beats since I use the fit pros, and boy was I disappointed. More than disappointed I was let down. I still have my Beats Studio 2’s from 2013 the silver titanium color way, and I’ve loved every minute of having them because of the loudness and club-like thump they have to them. They are relatable to one of the cars that passes by you with the windows shaking because the bass is so hard. Especially after 11 years that they still work and function the same as they did when I bought them minus a few cosmetic defects. So with high hopes and promises that these Beats Studio Pros would be just as great, I ordered them and got the maroon color because I liked the color. I should have known that if the colors have to be nice to make up for how awful the headphones were I wouldn’t have even glanced at these.These headphones are great if you want to listen to something and you have a hearing aid so it doesn’t hurt your ears. The sound is not nearly as loud as the 2013 model and being 11 years old I was very surprised. Apple has ruined the name Beats and all of their headphones minus the earbuds since all earbuds are relatively the same(I have the fit pros now and they are great) but the fact that brand new headphones can’t outperform 11 year old ones is just sad. Disappointing. A let down. I was thinking the new model would be the same if not better than the old ones I have since the treble and mids may have changed in the time I’ve had the headphones but I was so wrong. They sound almost the exact same with one major difference. The bass. The one thing that I feel most people loved about Beats was the bass and how it would sound like you just walked into a club when you wear them. I was utterly distraught. The studio pros on Bluetooth were so bass negative I thought I didn’t have the volume all the way up. Once I realized I did I thought maybe it was just the fact I wasn’t using one of the ‘3 specialized audio modes’ that the new model has. Even there I was let down. I played different songs, tried different audio settings on my phone like bass boosted and acoustic and rock but none of them helped the headphones. So after all the thoughts that went flooding through my head, one thing stuck out. Apple had ruined the classic Beats headphones. Don’t get me wrong the sound of the treble and mids was fine but still nothing compared to an 11 year old model. I was highly disappointed overall and would not recommend these to anyone even if they have an unlimited budget. It is just not worth the letdown.","March 28, 2024",AFDOLKER2GHNCK53GDAR2YNQPMVQ,True,170.0,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.02797865013774105,Positive,-0.9803,Negative

I'd like the highest level of noise cancelation to be better. I can still hear my kids when it's on, not as well as when it's off but I expected it to be better because of the price. But I enjoy there are different setting so I can hear all background noise if I need to. Sound quality is good for me. These are lacking on bass I enjoy some bass in my music so these really didn't meet that expectation. They are a bit tight like other people have said people with a larger head or ears might find them uncomfortable but I have smaller ears and head so it's good for me. The padding around the ear piece is very soft and comfortable. The padding on the head band is giving anti slip vibes but being anti slip it does pull hair a bit but it is soft and I don't feel like they are going to slide off my head if I'm moveing around. I haven't taken a phone call with them yet. Connecting to my android was extremely simple. Overall a good value for the price especially since I bought mine on sale but if you are looking for something that drowns out the entire world when you want a moment of peace maybe go with different headphones. If you don't mind hearing some noise all the time and just wanna drown out smaller back ground noise, have a small head/ears, enjoy a little less bass then these are great for the price.","May 16, 2024",AHGBWUQCNMQ2NZBJ4ZPFFNHVNCTQ,True,3.0,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.1285959383753502,Positive,0.9919,Positive

Typically it isn't easy to amplify all sounds at the same level and get clarity. Beats headphones have conquered this feat just like Bose. The noise cancellation filter is of good quality, canceling outside noise to bring clarity to high frequencies, midrange frequencies, and bass frequencies. This quality product will last but must be handled with care; support is available for troubleshooting if needed by Apple. The convenient Bluetooth feature allows connectivity to any smart device. In addition, the app allows control of the sound as desired. Beats headphones can be on the costly side, however, realize that you are getting quality and a product that will last.","June 4, 2024",AHPQQYBJQABAPUAVD4L3LEVH7JJA,True,0.0,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.2131349206349206,Positive,0.9595,Positive

RZGEO464CSXFR,B0D95134GD,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing product for the price,Eric,4,"After using the best studio pros for a while, I can definitely say that these are basically the Apple AirPod max’s but for a quarter of the price which is an amazing deal for the quality of headphones you are getting.Apple owns Beats and you get most of the features as if having AirPods and the accessibility of using them with iPhones . If you have an iPhone and pair it with the Beats Studio Pros, they will automatically pop up on your phone to connect like aipods do. Some of the same features include: being able to switch transparency/noise cancellation mode through your control center on your iPhone, Spatial Audio, Apple chip, ect. It is also lighter than Apple airpod max’s which is a huge plus for staying on your head. It includes an easy control system on the left ear on the headphones to allow you to play/pause, skip/go back, volume up/volume down, accept call/end call which is nice to be able to change the volume on the headphones which is something AirPods can’t do. They are very comfortable and sort of glue to your head and ears. You can adjust the headphones to fit to your liking as well. The color ways and the matte accent makes these headphones look slick to wear and overall they took out some small Beats decals on the previous headphones to make it look clean.Some flaws I have for the headphones are 1. That when you take them off your music will not automatically pause. This makes you take a small little step in either pausing the music on your phone, through the headphones, or continuing to play the music. I like how on the AirPods they automatically pause when you take an ear bud out so I wish these headphones did the same especially when Apple owns them. 2. They could be a tad louder. Don’t get me wrong, they are overall loud headphones but you have to get over half way in the volume to notice a loud change. Below halfway seems too quiet to me personally. 3. The case it comes in is slick, but the zipper design is annoying to get the headphones in and out of the case because the zipper hole is too small. Also the case is soft shelled and not hard so it’s not as protective as I want. 4. It’s a fingerprint magnetOverall if you are looking for high quality Bluetooth headphones, these are the best bang for your buck. Yes there are some flaws to this product, but the price is too hard to beat. These easily are the same audio quality as the airpod max if not better at quarter of the price. The design of the Beats Studio Pros have a better design than the max’s so I’d definitely suggest getting these if you want to save money.","January 13, 2024",AGNFNGIJ4UL3ZZAKLWLBZ4BGPDMQ,True,8.0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+,Beats Studio Pro,0.09373737373737376,Positive,0.9964,Positive

R3PEAUXF7SDQXL,B0CCZ26B5V,"5.0 out of 5 stars Above average, very light, great sound",Anna,5,"I’m a layperson, so let me first say I purchased these after much research but based on a “general audience’s” needs. What I mean by that, is my boyfriend mixes music, and while these are high quality this review isn’t for those types of people. This is for more layperson type of needs.1. I actually used chat gpt to compare and contrast numerous headphones based on my desires so if you’re needing help choosing that was very helpful to me.2. My needs were as follows: light, comfortable, noise cancelling, color, Bluetooth across devices, and ease of app use.3. I discovered that these headphones outdo their Sony competition specifically because they’re lighter and they don’t drop Bluetooth when you move to your computer from your phone for example. I found Sony has issues trying to switch back to your phone when on computer.Bluetooth is very important to me and a top need. I switch between devices enough for that to be a serious issue for me.4. I have a tiny head and am a 5’2 woman. I don’t have large proportions. For example my boyfriend is 6 foot with a large head and headphone weight won’t affect him the same way. For me headphones can literally be too heavy and fatiguing so my other main qualifier was that these are lighter than all but 1 of the top 7 brands out there.5. The cushion on these is shockingly luxurious and an added bonus.6. I get a mean case of sensitive ears, I always have. When I run my ears ache, in the cold my ears ache, if I am in a plane they ache. I am part of a certain population percentage (I’ve googled it’s around 30% but fact check me- this is for you though if you are like me) who have ear canals that actually can be very painful with the wrong pressure. For this reason I’m fairly picky about headphones which apply a significant amount of pressure. These headphones have not triggered this issue for me.7. I wanted good plane headphones and these will be great if I lean my head on the window area. The band doesn’t dig.8. They look really nice.9. The color options are cute10. The case is nice11. I heard for Sony there was popping on phone calls and it therefore became between these and Apple however apples are very very heavy. I ended up going with these for that reason. I have used them for numerous phone calls and haven’t had the issues, and people hear me easily and have had no issues hearing me. I did have popping once but I think it’s on the end of the person you’re on the phone with. My cousin was in his car shouting into his Bluetooth and I feel if he had been quieter it wouldn’t have happened. The popping has never occurred with music and is specific to a loud shout from someone on their own CarPlay so no biggie. Otherwise zero pop12. The noise cancelling is exceptional, I put them on and don’t play anything, but can no longer hear my AC at all. You understand generally the sound of constant AC. Like vrrrrrrrrr. It’s completely gone.13. Soothing without music to just make things less loud. Suitable for autistics who want a quieting incognito headphone that changes, also more comfy than alternative ear covers. (I am AuDHD.)14. Music can get really loud and nice lots of depth (layerperson opinion but my boyfriend said the sound quality is great and the next step up is just studio mixing headphones)15. If you wait for prime day or other sales they’re 150$ off usually (better than every other competitors prime or Black Friday deals)16. They seem durable and collapse in many ways so you can’t easily break them.17. The app has had no issues for me. Online there’s some app complaints and I have not run into them at all. The app seems to me very easy to navigate.","July 23, 2024",AENHF6YD4RSLEPKBFSQZK3DE3LBA,True,171.0,Color: White,Bose QuietComfort,0.15038318452380953,Positive,0.9571,Positive
RVR2I38IHHJWP,B0CCZ26B5V,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Headphones,Michael Wyatt,5,"As an army combat veteran, I’ve had my fair share of experiences with equipment designed to endure the harshest conditions. When I unboxed the Bose QC45 Noise Cancelling Headphones, I felt an immediate connection—not just to the quality of the product, but also to the striking army green color that resonates deeply with my military background. It’s a hue that evokes memories of resilience, strength, and camaraderie, making these headphones not just a gadget, but a personal statement.From the moment I put them on, I was enveloped in a cocoon of serenity. The noise-cancelling technology is nothing short of revolutionary; it feels as if the world outside has been muted, allowing me to immerse myself fully in my music, podcasts, or even the soothing silence I often crave after a long day. The sound quality is breathtaking, delivering rich, nuanced audio that makes every note come alive. Whether it’s the thunderous bass of my favorite tracks or the delicate strings of a classical symphony, the QC45s handle it all with remarkable precision.Comfort is paramount, especially for someone like me who has spent countless hours in gear that can be heavy and cumbersome. The QC45s are exceptionally lightweight and feature plush ear cushions that make long listening sessions a delight rather than a chore. I’ve worn them on long flights and during extended periods of downtime, and they never fail to impress with their ergonomic design.Additionally, the battery life is phenomenal. With up to 24 hours of wireless playback, I can enjoy uninterrupted listening without the constant worry of recharging. In a world where downtime is a luxury, the Bose QC45s ensure I can savor every moment without interruption.Overall, the Bose QC45 Noise Cancelling Headphones have exceeded my expectations in every regard. They are a testament to the brand’s dedication to quality, performance, and innovation. For anyone seeking an unparalleled audio experience—whether you’re a music aficionado, a frequent traveler, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of silence—these headphones are an invaluable addition to your arsenal. And for veterans like myself, the army green color serves as a proud reminder of our legacy, merging functionality with a touch of personal history.

After having surgery, and living in the middle of a chaotic house for a few months, I and my sanity needed some better noise canceling. Thanks to prime day and a deep discount on these, decided to try it out.Oh my God.They are the best noise canceling headphones I have ever used. They beat out my AirPods my AirPod Pro, numerous beats, and the slew of other cheap options I tried. Not only does it do a great job of quieting the noise (You can never truly cancel noise like people, talking, dogs, barking, etc.) But the sound quality blew me away. I never thought that I could hear a difference, then I tried these headphones I now sleep in them, So I can fall asleep to audiobooks and have gotten the best sleep I’ve ever gotten. I have been using them for over a month now, and the performance has been consistent.They feel very light on and fit comfortably over my ears. The battery life is astonishing. I can leave them on all night and wake up to about 80% battery. They charge in no time too .While the price tag is daunting, I am so glad that I was able to try these because I will never not have them near me henceforth.

RTOEPK2F01IIV,B0CCZ26B5V,"4.0 out of 5 stars Bose is, as usual, worth the (on sale) price",Miss History,4,"There's just something about Bose quality and design. These headphones are perfect if you're looking for good sound quality, excellent noise cancelling, and--maybe most importantly for me--comfort. I don't know how they did it, but these really are crazy comfy to wear. They have a snug fit to boost sound quality and noise blocking, but they aren't tight at all and have a very nice, cushiony feel. I inevitably get headaches from wearing any other over-ear headphones for very long, but I've gone hours with these on my head and almost forgotten they're even there. I also like that they're not super-duper big and ostentatious. I'm not looking to wear these as a loud fashion statement and I like how sleek they are as-is. And I love the way they fold up to fit in their nice little case. It's the least awkward folding-of-headphones I've seen so far.I'm not an aficionado when it comes to sound quality, but I can tell you from personal experience and preference that the quality on these is great. Not the best out there, since, hey, you're not paying $600+ for these, but excellent nonetheless for me. You do have to have the volume up a bit to get the really epic listening experience, but that's no different from other over-ear headphones I've owned. The connected app is a no-frills affair that lets you adjust the sound a bit to your liking, and you can create additional listening modes with your preferred EQ, but I've been happy with the as-is modes already programmed into it. Set up with the app was blessedly uneventful. It connected on the first try and I've never had a bit of trouble connected new devices to my headphones. Glorious.Let's talk noise-cancelling. When that switch is flipped, the world outside your headphones is gone. It doesn't feel unnatural like you're sitting in a vacuum, but it does let you happily escape all the noisy distractions around you and just enjoy whatever you're listening to at whatever volume you prefer. I have to formally announce to anyone else home that I'm putting my headphones on because, aside from physically touching me or doing some acrobatics in my direct line of sight, I can't hear them at all if they're trying to get my attention--which, obviously, I love. Kind of the point of noise cancelling, right?The design of the headphones is simple and to the point in terms of controls. The last two pair of headphones I owned before these had awkwardly placed buttons for volume and pausing. I would always fumble to find them even after owning them for years. The controls on these Bose headphones are somehow placed just perfectly, and my fingers land on them on the first try every time. It's a little thing since a lot of us use our phones or smart watches to change the song and what not, but when I really am immersed and want to leave all distractions aside, using the controls on the headphones is a nice little treat, and that lack of fumbling to find them goes a long way to allowing me to stay in that happy and calm little headspace.I want to give these five stars for the price I paid (which, btw, was a sale price of 249.99 USD), but there's a couple of small, intertwined drawbacks for me that puts them at between a 4 and 4.5: the battery life and the power toggle/slider. The battery life is, in a word, fine. My previous headphones went for weeks of sporadic, casual listening without me needing to charge them, but they weren't as fancy and they weren't noise-cancelling. These Bose headphones need fairly regular charging, which isn't the end of the world, especially since--I assume--they use up more battery thanks to the awesomely effective noise-cancelling. It will last a long airplane trip but you'll need to charge it pretty soon after that or else you're going to be sans-headphones for at least part of the flight home.Then there's the power toggle. In general, I love this little toggle/slider. It's nothing but a tiny, silly, minor inconvenience, but I'm not a fan of the hold-this-for-a-little-while power buttons that also double as the button you need to activate Bluetooth/Bluetooth pairing. I always feel like an idiot when it's time to pair a new device to it and I can't figure out if I need to triple press the power button or what. A nice, small and easily accessible toggle/slider to turn the headphones on and off? Fantastic.The downside? You sure as heck better remember to turn the headphones off when you're not using them or they're going to remain on until the battery dies. In my experience, with that all-powerful toggle there is no automatic powering off if you leave the headphones out of use for an extended period of time. It will just drain that battery until the headphones are dead. It's a simple solution--just remember to scoot that slider to off when you're done with them! But, lamentably, I'm super forgetful and easily distracted, and some of you might be the same. I've now accidentally left my headphones on three times, and even though it is my fault, I've been pretty bummed that my headphones are totally dead when I pull them out again after that moment of forgetfulness. The automatic powering off after inactivity in my previous headphones is the one feature that I really, really miss. Is this a dealbreaker? Would I go back to those headphones because of this? Absolutely not. But from one concerned, forgetful listener to another, just remember to manually power down, even if you think you're only going to be stepping away from your headphones for two seconds :)Would I buy these again? In a heartbeat, but I probably won't need to. I've had them for seven months now but, if they're anything like the Bose speakers I've owned, they're going to last me a lot longer yet. Would I pay the full 350 USD price for them? Maybe. I got mine on sale, and they were even cheaper during Prime Day 2024. They're an awesome set of headphones, but if the price is still a little steep for you, maybe add them to your list and keep an eye on it. Bose products tend to go on sale periodically for much better discounts than, say, Apple products, especially around the holiday season.","July 26, 2024",AHVOHVELL2RNLNFZWLVM3UY2OH3A,True,16.0,Color: Black,Bose QuietComfort,0.17462548768104322,Positive,0.9987,Positive

I had gone to Best Buy to actually try these headphones along with others and I picked these. The Beats Pros were tight and pressed on my ears which would for sure hurt after a while. Sony headphones felt cheap and like they’d break easily.I like these because they cup around your ear and don’t squeeze your head to where it’s uncomfortable. The feel sturdy and like they will hold up. The sound quality is amazing and I think way better than the Beats Pros. In the Bose app you can change the EQ to whatever you’d like which is a great customization. Also, I thought about getting the Ultras but they were a bit too pricy and only had a little extra stuff. Another great thing is you can create your own modes and adjust how much noise is drowned out. Lastly, these come in a great color, I love the blue shade.Overall I 100% recommend these and they are worth the price! However I did get them during Amazon prime at $199 so that also helped. So if you can’t decide between headphones I’d say go for these ones!","August 15, 2024",AEFHQ76CUQSZR2EO3ROXCM53BD7A,True,10.0,Color: Moonstone Blue,Bose QuietComfort,0.30881211180124224,Positive,0.9881,Positive

As someone who values high-quality audio and effective noise cancellation, these headphones have truly impressed me.First and foremost, the noise-cancelling feature is phenomenal. Whether I’m on a busy commute, working in a noisy café, or just trying to relax at home, the Bose QuietComfort headphones create an incredibly serene listening environment. The active noise cancellation technology blocks out external sounds so effectively that it feels like I’m in my own private sound bubble.The sound quality is top-notch as well. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced across all genres. Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the clarity and richness of the sound make every experience enjoyable.Comfort is another area where these headphones truly shine. The plush ear cushions and adjustable headband ensure a perfect fit for extended listening sessions. I’ve worn them for hours on end without any discomfort, which is a testament to their ergonomic design.Battery life is impressive, too. I easily get up to 24 hours of playback on a single charge, making them ideal for long flights, commutes, or extended work sessions. And if you’re in a pinch, a quick charge gives you hours of additional listening time.The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and reliable. Pairing with my devices is quick and hassle-free, and the connection stays strong even when I’m moving around.Overall, the Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones are worth every cent.

R1CKN589J52EL5,B0CCZ26B5V,5.0 out of 5 stars Quiet and (mostly) comfortable indeed.,Reviewer MHM 3-5,5,"This is my first pair of Bose headphones. Initial impressions before even putting them on was “Dang, these are expensive headphones,” and at $349.99, yes, they are. There’s hundreds of headphones on the market, many of them with noise cancelling, that are available for far less money. But, considering my first pair of ANC Headphones were the original Beats by Dr. Dre Studios, and adjusted for inflation since 2011, I paid $416 for those, these are certainly more than competitive. Also, there’s a reason that for the past several years, when people bring up noise cancelling headphones, they are usually talking about Sony or Bose as their reference point. They are quality. They do the job well. Let’s dive in.1. ANC2. Comfort3. Sound4. Build Quality5. Feature Set6. Who should buy these?Ok, so as I said, my previous ANC Headphones are the original Beats Studios, and my most recent over the ear headphones purchase was the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x back in 2017. I’ll be comparing these to my experience with the both of them. Maybe also in comparison to my gaming headset, the Razer Barracuda X.First off, the noise cancelling itself, since this lineup is called QUIETComfort. Pretty darn good. Honestly, I can’t say that it’s any better than my reference point of headphones from 2011, but still positive experience. Blocks out basically all voices (except the higher range like baby cries), and I couldn’t hear any other noise around me when in use. Can’t complain.Now for the QuietCOMFORT portion of the equation. Compared to both of my previous headphones, it’s a serious improvement. The Beats and Audio-Technica both were heavy over the top of my skull, creating discomfort over extensive sessions where I would shift the band forward and backward over my head to give a break to the affected area. My Razer Barracuda X are also lightweight, and up to this point were the most comfortable in this regards, but the Bose definitely have more padding on the band. That said, I still have experienced the same over the skull discomfort with these headphones, and the band has to be loosened to address it. Obviously, that means the headphones overall sit more loosely on my head and are less secure.The earcups have sufficient padding for my ears, and they don’t make contact, so though they are shallow, they aren’t as shallow as others I’ve owned where the speaker housings press against the outer cartilage of my ear. This, again makes for a comfortable experience over time. Like other headphones I’ve owned, definitely heat buildup inside the earcups, and these are no exception, with condensation gathering on the material. Yep, I was sweaty listening to these. But I live in the desert, so there’s that. Your experience may vary based on your location and if you run generally warm or not.The sound quality over playback is pleasant, and anything I’ve found unpleasant I can adjust easily with the Bose app to tune the EQ to my liking. I blame anything I haven’t liked to my various EQ settings (iOS, Spotify, Bose app combinations) and the source of the audio (Spotify streaming) more than the quality of the sound itself. Both my ATH-M50x and Barracuda X have mostly neutral sound, with the ATH being legitimate studio monitors being only slightly warm and the Barracuda having neutral with slight emphasis to bass for obvious reasons: gaming you want to hear footsteps, and higher bass emphasis aids immersion in game. Obviously, the Beats were very warm, and had bass emphasized beyond the Barracudas. So if I were to place the Bose in the comparison, I’d say its default sound is warm, not neutral, but definitely not as bass heavy as anything Beats put out in 2011 (and from what I read, remains bass heavy in the present). These aren’t studio monitors or reference headphones or audiophile headphones. They’re meant to just make your music sound good with little fuss, with the ability to tune to your liking. If you want audiophile headphones, neither Bose nor Sony nor Beats offerings in this segment meet that criteria. If you want bass heavy headphones, Bose, Sony, JBL have extensive options in that regards at several price points. As already stated, this meets the middle ground between neutral and bass emphasized. It’s warm out of the box, but not at the detriment of the rest of the range. Everything from low to high is clear and crisp. Nothing is overly harsh.Build quality is a little bit of a concern of mine. It’s very hard to find a set of headphones not made entirely out of plastic and no exception here. The inherent design of my OG Beats, though also loaded with plastic, felt sturdier, but the only moving points on those were the hinges, and to a far lesser degree, the cups moved on slight swivels to lay flat on your head. So it makes sense that they’d feel sturdy when there wasn’t a lot of pivot and rotation points. On these, the headphones have folding and rotating ear cups, and at all points across the build, there feels like there’s flex in it. I worry very much that my toddler or baby would get a hold of them and twist them to pieces. I don’t have that concern with either my Audio-Technica headphones, also mostly plastic, nor the Corsair gaming headset my toddler uses for his drum kit, which gets tossed around, stepped on, kicked around, and keeps on going just fine. But, as previously stated, the material choice keeps weight down, which keeps comfort high, like my Barracuda X. Both have lots of lightweight plastic. Both need to be kept away from kids that don’t know how to treat things with delicate touch. Though I know people do go for a run or workout with these, I wouldn’t recommend it. I don’t know if they’d survive a fall, and they’re not IPX rated anyhow against sweat or other moisture. Seriously, get some IPX rated headphones or use some earbuds for sweaty, motion filled sessions. Keep these for the office, study, travel, and everyday listening. With that said, these still feel like a premium product. They don’t feel cheap. I’m just leveling with anyone that is considering these of what their limitations may be.Feature set for these is quite extensive, and y’all can do your research on every last bit. Will just point out some things I was curious about when I purchased these.- The ANC has two presets: Quiet and Aware. You can craft your own presets in the app, and adjust them based on your liking and whether or not you think you’ll encounter wind. So far I find these basically pointless. I don't need to fine tune how much ANC I have. I either want to hear things, or don't.- The app also supports any firmware updates and allows you to tune your EQ to your liking. I can’t stand that there’s multiple Bose apps. I use one for these headphones and one for my Soundlink Flex. I really wish Bose would consolidate all their consumer, portable audio (meaning headphones, earbuds, and travel speakers) into one app. I don’t know why I need two apps for devices that both come and go with me. I’d be more forgiving of multiple apps along portable products versus home products (such as in-wall speakers and home theater speakers). It's especially confusing when the Soundlink Flex MAX is in the Bose Music app with the QuietComforts, but the Soundlink Flex is not. So weird, so pointless. Anyhow, I digress.- Like all QC lineups, these headphones also support analog playback over a traditional cable. They also all feature an asymmetric plug arrangement, 2.5mm on one end and 3.5mm on the other. Unlike the more expensive QuietComfort Ultras, this pair of headphones I’m reviewing allows for passive playback. If you run out of charge or are preserving charge, you can still use these without ANC and listen over the cable. And it has in-line mic as well. This gives you far more flexibility than the Ultras, and allows these headphones to serve double duty as an in-a-pinch gaming headset for an Xbox controller, and to continue to support phone calls, etc. through the in-line microphone even if you cannot or choose not to power them on. I cannot believe that Bose’s flagship product, the Ultras, do not offer that same versatility. This product would be even better if you could use these speakers powered but without ANC features (quiet or aware) enabled to conserve battery power, but retain the convenience of wireless.- Driver size is 35mm to the Ultras 40mm. My ATH-M50x, aptly named, are closer to 50mm drivers, and I believe the Barracuda X are 40mm or so. But the playback volume on the Bose seems louder and, obviously is more versatile than my analog only ATH-M50x comparison. The Barracuda, also wireless, are still less versatile in that they require the USB-C dongle or the analog cable to function, and lack ANC. Bluetooth 5+ is just far more versatile, even if it has latency that the aforementioned devices do not.- Main differences between these and the Ultras include the driver size (Ultra is larger), the amount of microphones used for ANC (the Ultra has more), the inclusion of Immersive Audio on the Ultras (like Spatial Audio on Apple… I’m honestly not sold by that at this time), battery life (these are longer than the Ultra), and the physical structure of them differ. These are just another rehash of the QC35, QC45 design, the Ultras are unique in their structure.They arrived at 60% charge and I listened to them for about 30 minutes before placing them on a USB-C charger. Within an hour I was at 100%. Could’ve been quicker. Idk. Was in the backyard playing with the kiddos and listening to the Bose Soundlink Flex (go buy one of those, I’d recommend that to anybody).So, who are these headphones for? A lot of people, but let’s face it, $349.99 will price out a lot of buyers. I’d recommend my existing ATH-M50x to people that want to spend under $200 and only care about reliable sound. I’d recommend Sony ULT ANC Headphones for people with $200 to spend that want ANC and plan on listening to Pop, Hip-Hop, EDM (their ANC is nearly as good as XM5, Sony’s competitor to these Bose… but they’re very bass heavy). I’d recommend Audio-Technica again to people with a budget of $100.These are a luxury product. I’m aware that there are headphones far more expensive than these. But these are still expensive to many people. At this price point, I’d expect no less than 5 years of usage, and as I’ve already stated, I’ve used $150 headphones for 7 years now. So with that said, a couple of points of advice to someone weighing investing into these:- These go on sale periodically down to $249.99. At that price, they’re still premium, but far more competitive against the likes of Sony XM5 and Apple AirPods Max.- Bose Refurbished is a great option. The warranty is exactly the same as the brand new product, and you save money. I’ve done just that with my Soundlink Flex and have been so happy. I’m doing it again with the QuietComfort Ultras, which I snagged at $259.99, instead of their new list price of $429.99.Okay, enough money talk. Back to who these are for. If you made it this far, the $249.99-$349.99 is obviously something you’re considering as a fair value.So with that said, if you are a professional or student that wants to block out the noise around you for hours on end so you can work, these are for you.If you use public transport and want headphones to help you escape the noise, these are for you. Just, uh, be aware of your surroundings. Ya know, be safe. Yadda yadda.If you want legendary ANC, comfort, sound quality as you go through the airport and on your plane, these are for you.If you want some good headphones for the gym, I’d say you won’t be disappointed, but I’d encourage you to do some research for other headphones before you make a plan to routinely sweat into or potentially toss about headphones that are not made for either.If you’re the type of parent that wants to spoil your kid with great headphones, I’d say keep looking unless you find your child as responsible and respectful as a grown adult. I would certainly have broken these as a kid, and maybe even as a teen out of negligence (i.e. tossing my loaded backpack around or something and accidentally smashing something inside or nearby, hard case or not). There are many great headphones out there for less money, and some that are more sturdy. If you want to bless your child that way, do some serious research first, amongst serious review websites that breakdown sound quality, build quality, etc.Wow, look at you! You made it through my Amazon novel! I mean review. Yeah, that's what I meant. Hope it gave you some things to think about as you find the perfect headphones for you.

RUR84RZ9061M0,B0CCZ26B5V,5.0 out of 5 stars ANC HEADPHONE COMPARISON: BOSE QUIETCOMFORT / 1MORE SONOFLOW / BEATS SOLO PRO / AIR PODS PRO,ITMCT,5,"I’ve owned & extensively used the Beats Solo Pros & Air Pods Pros. I gave the Beats to my daughter as the ‘on-the-ear’ design was causing me pain on flights. I migrated to the AirPods Pros hoping I’d get similar performance to the Beats with more comfort and less bulk on flights. Ultimately, the Air Pods Pros just won’t stay in my ears and the ANC just isn’t as effective due to the lack of ear covers or better plugs. So recently I ordered the new Bose QuietComforts and the 1More Sonoflows to compare. I was hopeful on the 1More product due to being on sale for $67 and that the price savings would outweigh any deficits. But ultimately I am going with the Bose QCs. This is my personal opinion and what works best for me. Keep in mind I have not extensively tested the Bose or 1More yet, but spent a day alternating between the two so this is based on initial impressions. Categories are in personal order of importance.COMFORT/DESIGN: I gave up the Beats due to pain/pressure from prolonged use of the on the ear cups. I am also not a fan of the Air Pods Pro design, nor getting them to fit in my ears well and stay (I love the original air pods, and I’ve tried multiple buds for the Pros). I have a large head so the Beats had to be fully extended to be on my head properly which probably increased pressure. They fit my adult daughter much better. The Bose QCs don’t require full extension on me, completely cover my ears, and the cups are really soft. The 1More product covers completely, and is comfortable, but heavier & puts more pressure around my ears than the Bose, so I’m skeptical if I’d want to wear them more than an hour or so. The pressure is a drawback especially given the ANC performance noted next.RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > Beats SoloPro > Air Pods ProANC: In my immediate comparison of the Bose QCs and the 1More Sonoflow, there was a large difference in noise cancellation. I use an infrared heater in my office sometimes that is pretty noisy. Comparable to airplane noise but quieter. The Bose is very effective against it despite fitting looser than the 1More product. But the Bose has less options than the Beats for ANC modes and I found the Beats to be slightly better at full ANC than the Bose and quicker to switch modes. The Air Pods are at a disadvantage here being an earbud product but they are effective and travel light. The 1More product was the worst performer on ANC for me.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Bose QuietComfort > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.SOUND/EQ/APP: I always found the Beats Solo Pros to be balanced, clear, dynamic and pleasant. Integrated with Apple, they worked great though many audiophiles will complain about the lack of EQ adjustments. I liked the simplicity of them and not having to have an additional app. Same goes for the Air Pods. The Bose Sound is very good, as you would expect from Bose, and their App is simple and ok. Out of the box very good and you can tune them to preference. The 1More Product out of the box is definitely at the bottom of the pile. It had an almost metallic, chunky, machine sound to me. You can adjust them, update firmware, and tune them with the app which made the largest difference in the performance compared to the others. The app did have a neat white noise feature with some different options. It also had twice as many EQ adjustments points over the Bose. Ultimately, I enjoy the Bose sound the most followed by the Beats and AirPods and then the 1More, but once tuned all are very good, especially if ANC with music or video on an airplane are your target use.RANKING: Bose QC > Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY: For me, I love the Beats functionality. Buttons are intuitive and easy to use, typical tactile Apple design. AirPods are similar. So far the Bose is ok, it’s intuitive and the buttons seem like they will be easy to learn. The 1More Sonoflow is last here. All buttons on the right side, the power button in front doubles as a function button and for me it’s awkward trying to find it on the front. The 1More is last by a bit for me here.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > Bose QC > 1More SonoflowCASE: Beats Case is cheap and not protective at all. AirPods are AirPods. The 1More Case fits but is a bit bulky, rounded, and the included accessory net is too small. The Bose Case is well made, stiff, protective, has a large accessory net, and is rectangular shaped. Personally I see it fitting in a carry on laptop bag or backpack much easier.RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > AirPods Pro > Beats Solo ProBATTERY LIFE: This is of limited importance to me. But it seems to get tons of mention in every online review you read. The headphones all have insanely long run times compared to older devices. I always charge before a trip and never seem to end up with dead devices. Charge your stuff. Not that hard.","February 22, 2024",AHDJUVOQFM3KYWPZVTOVBIJ7ADIA,True,119.0,Color: Cypress Green,Bose QuietComfort,0.20227894445979544,Positive,0.9984,Positive
R2BYJJXMGVVB1G,B0CCZ26B5V,"5.0 out of 5 stars Always a good pair of headphones, but....",MiamiOne,5,"I have the QC45, NC700 and recently gave a relative the QC35ii's (only because they don't use the USB-C plug). Plus, it gave me an excuse to buy this QuietComfort.The reviewers said that the new Quiet Comfort headphones sounded better, and since they were on sale for $200, I grabbed them. They look and feel just like the QC45's I have.As for sound I really CANNOT honestly swear that I can hear a difference compared to the QC45.I think they have a stronger bass tone, but that could just be in my mind to justify purchasing another set of Bose! For we have some wired QC25's too.What did happen, is to avoid buyer's remorse, I finally played with the EQ settings on the Bose app, which did truly kick up the sound quality, which I always thought was good, but kind of flat.Of course, when I applied the new settings to the NC700's and QC45's, I got the same improvements.The main advantage of these is the app allows you to select from a choice of presets in the EQ modes, that the NC700 and QC45 don't have access too. Have I used any of those presets. NO!Bottomline- Great Bose headphones, as good as the others. You may hear an improvement in the strength of the bass tone. But are they an absolute necessity over the existing QC45, or QC35ii's, not in my mind.However, as I indicated I still have excellent QC25 wired Bose headphones, and they are still good. So know, if you have Bose, they should last a long time.Hopefully, the Ultra's won't drop down to $250, because I know I will buy them.","August 25, 2024",AHTOEU4ZUVLOOLCFT5LXEI7KKQMA,True,0.0,Color: Cypress Green,Bose QuietComfort,0.24616068088290308,Positive,0.9923,Positive
ROG20CQUWLEBQ,B0CCZ26B5V,"4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful sound quality, somewhat flimsy",VM Express,4,"I've had these Bose QuietComfort NC Headphones for about a month now, and I really like how they feel and sound. For context, I have tried out about 5 different pairs in the last 6 years, starting with some Plantronics PRO's back in 2017, which i still use occasionally for travel. Then I moved to some Sony ones which I did not like. All of these other headphones were wireless and noise cancelling in the $100 to $150 range. They each had some shortfall that made them hard to use. Honestly out of all my previous headphoen the Plantronics were the best in quality and durability and Battery life. Sony always had connectivity issues and would crash randomly. Even the mid range model WHCH710N which had a lot of issues. They would randomly crash during zoom calls or listening to music. Happened about 3-4 times a week, it was getting really annoying.I decided to tier up my headphones because I use them for work daily. I thought it was a worth while investment. I decided to go with Bose because of the name recognition and because I have seen many of my peers use them (Im a Software Engineer).My first impressions of the Bose headphones were :- Light- Easy to setup - reliable bluetooth connection (something Sony was lacking)- Excellent sound quality (Best sound quality - on par and slightly better than my Plantronics)- Comfortable (The most comfortable out of all the other headphones I've used)To elaborate further. A common pain point I've experienced is difficulty pairing and dealing with unstable bluetooth connections with my other headphones. I rightfully assumed that this was a price point issue, because I have not had that problem with the Bose headphones. The Bose headphones were easy to setup, they also have apps to help with it. But you can use them without any apps.They are very comfortable and fairly light, comparing to others i've used. I sometimes wear these for 6-10 hours a day and I never have that weird ear pain that you can develop from wearing headphones for long. I have very big ears so that is saying something.Sound quality is excellent. Deep bass with excellent sound range, very satisfying to listen to. They also have a great volume range. This is what Bose is known for so they definitely get this right.CON 1:They do feel rather flimsy. For this price point I expected more metal parts. The materials look well made and have excellent form factor. The headphones however are completely plastic from what I can tell. I feel like one good tug would snap the hinges on the ear pieces. This is a serious concern when you're wearing lose clothing or a hoodie. The headphone could get caught in the folds of your clothing and if were to pull hard or fast while going through the motions you might break them. I have no data to back this up obviously because I am not going to throw away perfectly good headphones to test that theory but you can sort of tell by holding them and pulling on them a little.CON 2:Battery life isn't great. If I forget to turn them off at the end of my work day they somehow continue to deplete the battery. The following morning they are already at 50% battery. So that is 50% a day with only 6-8 hours of actual work (active use). For reference, my old Plantronics headphones last for several days without needing a recharge. I have gone on to use them for 5+ days without having to charge them. Even the mid-range Sony headphones perform ""slightly"" better than this. I know it's good practice to turn them off after you're done but one forgets to do that far more often than one would think. There is room for improvement here.Overall i'd say these are excellent headphones with great sound quality and form factor. Do take a little extra care because they are not the most durable headphones out there.

R2AKDHTMK4Z3G,B0CCZ26B5V,5.0 out of 5 stars they are a travel day game changer,Amanda,5,"I love these headphones. They were exactly what I was looking for. The green color is perfect and versatile. They're super comfortable around the ears and there is padding at the top of the head, which actually makes a huge difference when wearing for a long period of time. I wore them when traveling recently and I don't think I can ever fly without them now.. I can be pretty sensitive to sound and stimulation, so drowning out the sound of crowds in the airport and the loud hum of the plane during flight was absolutely amazing. It was actually kind of jarring to take them off mid flight and realize how well they work! My husband works from home and works different hours than I do, so it's so helpful to be able to wear them while reading, relaxing, listening to something, or taking a call of my own while he's on a call in the other room. The microphone has been super clear when I've hooked them up to my computer. And Aware mode is perfect for when I'm taking a walk in the neighborhood and want to listen to a podcast. It's doesn't feel safe to walk with complete noise cancellation, so this is the perfect solution. I did a good bit of research before making this purchase and I decided to spend a little more on the trusted Bose brand; definitely made the right choice for me.","September 3, 2024",AGSZECCIDLZ5QQ2SIANWULK3VMZA,True,0.0,Color: Cypress Green,Bose QuietComfort,0.3316633597883597,Positive,0.9956,Positive

I got a good deal, and they were back-ordered.I recognize Bose at where they excell- great noise cancelling, build quality, comfort and a headband, above all, that will last. The Sony WH-1000xm sounded great, balanced, but the headband was a complete travesty. I've done a nice electrical tape repair and have them as backup. They still sound good.Bose has never excelled in fidelity. They sound good in a way. Pleasing, warm, bassy, bottomy., a bit soupy, syruppy. But I have a Bachelor of Music on guitar and minored in Sound Recording Technology. and I had learned to listen very critically to timbre and space and musicality at a very young age.It will please the masses. Bose are a bunch of legacy MIT electrical engineers and physics majors and phDs fashioned in the image of their guru founder, Amar Bose who himself was an MIT phD electrical engineer.. And if any one of them actually has musicality and musical judgment, they're certainly not allowed to speak it into the product.As far as high fidelity, Bose was ragged on when the company actually tried competing in the so-called high-end loudspeaker space as ""BOSE= Buy Other Stereo Equipment"". They don't really image great, they don't have shimmering, glistening silky highs, the bottom was usually muddy.I will say the bottom is pretty pleasing on these.","September 2, 2024",AHVVHHHNH6RI4IOQM5D4TCOHBSYQ,True,0.0,Color: Moonstone Blue,Bose QuietComfort,0.25991758241758245,Positive,0.9872,Positive

Highly recommend for those 3 kid single moms who don't want to hear micky mouse club house no more. I mean being able to click that aware button though and interact with them when necessary is pretty golden. Definitely get to know your settings and where your EQ is located and play around with your settings because I definitely don't listen to a good jam with drums and bass at the same settings as I would some, pink floid, jamiroquai, sia, morgan wailen. You could but you don't have to, you can change em with the touch of a quick button. Slick. Its refreshing to have an astetic click and button sensation again instead of swiping my sony xm3s all backwards and sideways. I would go as far as saying bose puts you back in control again and I hope they never loose this feature or i will be guarding these QCs with my life. Weight is good on the head, fit is natural over the ears, only slightly protruding further than my ears. My kids can swing their arms around me and i dont get bashed i can headbang or more so nod and they dont travel. I can look down to change diapers look up to hang clothes. Rocking in my rocker on the porch and they dont budge. Only drawback i can think is they can be toasty on these hot AZ nights but over the ears in AZ kind of comes with the territory. im glad i seen washable silicone liners available. The app interface is streamlined and user friendly. Over all astounding, im gonna match up some socks and see what mickey is about to paint and listen to my kiddo shout out what colors he's using.

R2F1FITP5STPE4,B0CCZ26B5V,"4.0 out of 5 stars So far, mostly so good",Holt,4,"I have been looking for a pair of noise cancelling headphones, and my family and friends swear by Bose. I wanted a pair for the metro, because I find that the usual earbud style of headphones can be difficult to hear on a noisy metro without cranking the volume higher than I think is probably good for regular listening. I had been looking at these headphones for a while, comparing them to other Bose products and other headphones. When they went on sale, I went for it. They are pretty easy to use, and easily connect to my phone. I wore them for most of a 33 hour journey between the US and SE Asia, and the battery I think maybe went down to 40%, so that held up very well. They are comfortable, and block the sound of a jet engine well, making it easy to hear my audio book. I have recently worn them on the noisy metro, and it was great; could keep my volume at a normal level and still hear. My only reason for not giving this a 5/5 is that, on that plane, the connection between the headphones and my phone would cut out--just for a second or so--but it did it a fair bit on the flight. It hasn't done it again since getting off the plane [at least not yet] so I am hoping it was a one-time thing, but I am a bit worried about that, especially since these were not cheap headphones, even on sale.","August 11, 2024",AHNOAM5DAQYEKUJUVDCF3IFAQREA,True,0.0,Color: Cypress Green,Bose QuietComfort,0.15977777777777774,Positive,0.7972,Positive

Both have long battery life’s.For these specifically:Pros:- Noise cancellation pretty good- Love the colorCons:- I would say around 2% of the time sound comes out crackly. It’s not that often but is not great when just trying to watch a video.- For the price I expected better…not the equivalent or lower quality than ones that are $100 less.Overall not a bad choice.

R3J47OJ199W8H6,B0CCZ26B5V,"3.0 out of 5 stars Pros and cons, but look elsewhere for working from home",Nathan,3,"I purchased these headphones for the purpose of working from home in a call center environment for 8hr a day. My main reasons for purchasing were: to go wireless, and increase comfort. I am often in meetings and calls for hours at a time, and the headphones my organization provided were painful.On my first day of use, I noticed a couple issues. First issue is that on Windows and Mac the microphone volume is far too low. Nobody on Microsoft Teams or my call center software could hear me. I needed to install a separate application to artificially boost the microphone by around 20dB. Second issue I noticed is regarding having two devices connected at the same time. Example: If you are actively streaming audio from a Windows computer, and then your iPhone gets a text notification, the headphones will cut the audio from the Windows computer to play the iPhone notification. When this happens, your Bluetooth connection either drops, or the audio quality gets very bad (crackling, stutters, etc) and you need to disconnect/reconnect devices.On my second day of use, I experienced random drops in audio quality and needed to power off/on the headphones 3 times.Bose has many suggestions and troubleshooting steps in their support articles, which I have gone through. That being said, these headphones are fine. I will keep them and enjoy them for my work (when they are working) and enjoy them for traveling. That being said, I do wish I would have gone with a Microsoft Teams certified device instead for my purposes. This product appears to be more intended for casual use as opposed to professional use.The sound quality is very good compared to my Sennheiser HD598. Audio is very clear, especially in the mid to high frequencies. Other reviews mention a lack of bass, but I found the bass to be MORE than enough. The active noise cancellation has a huge impact on music listening; I feel like the sound stage is very wide as I can hear many details in songs I haven't picked up on before.Noise cancellation is insanely good. I don't have a great basis for comparison, but it's almost eerie how silent the world is when you have these on. At most, I can barely hear a super loud fan a few feet away, or I barely hear the faucet when washing dishes. I look forward to using these while doing chores around the house!Comfort and fit is great for only 2 days of use. They are much more comfortable than I expected, as I have a big head and typically need to ""break in"" headphones a little bit longer. I had these headphones on for hours and they didn't give me any issues.Overall, despite the annoying connection issues I have with these things I am going to keep them. I like them enough to where I am willing to work around these issues for now. The next time I need to travel these are going to be a life saver. I can't wait to finally sleep on planes! If you're working from home, I would recommend seeking a Microsoft Teams certified pair of headphones.","August 8, 2024",AGM4QCFYMZPGNDXBEQO4S7UZ4KQQ,True,3.0,Color: Black,Bose QuietComfort,0.10775537634408602,Positive,0.9901,Positive

Those were super neat but after a bit I would get some minor headaches because the fit was a bit tight, even after adjusting them. These QC headphones are the most comfortable headphones I've worn ever. I can wear them for hours and it'd feel fine, which I love. My head is a bit small, so I have a hard time finding comfortable headphones that don't look funky.The sound quality is perfect for me! I am not too picky about sounds because I can't really tell too much of a difference, but I think these sound perfectly find and clear. There are two modes already set up. There's the noise canceling one which works perfectly, and the aware mode. For these headphones, I'd say the aware mode still blocks out a good amount of noise, but that's perfectly fine for me.Overall, I love the quality and the comfort of these headphones. Definitely worth the price (I got it on sale!).","August 16, 2024",AHBW7DLXOFKNSM5CRHYJML3FFHMQ,True,1.0,Color: White,Bose QuietComfort,0.3415343915343915,Positive,0.9974,Positive
R1BS7PY9NIRGOX,B0CCZ26B5V,5.0 out of 5 stars Really amazing,frankfrank,5,"I have had lots of $40-60 headphones in my life and a few that did noise cancelling, and these blow them all out of the water by a huge margin.If you have some music on and noise cancelling enabled you will absolutely not hear your kids/wife in the same room unless they yell very loudly or happen to speak sharp/loud/quick at a perfect break in the music. These should be more heavily marketed to fathers everywhere to allow them to get 30 minutes of peace after work. Even without the music on it still blocks out as much noise as an average set of shooting earmuffs.In the ""aware"" mode you'll hear everything in your life just as good as you would with a single headset off your ear and the other one on, playing music.The bluetooth works great, connecting to multiple devices (phone and PC etc) at once with no foolish rules/policies that make it annoying.The other reviewers saying you have to have an app to use these are definitely wrong. You can install the app if you want extra features but you can also just pair it to your phone/tablet/pc like any other device and use it as-is. That's exactly what I did and it works great with all the standard features you would expect.Excellent hardware/buttons etc:- L side button switches between NC and ""aware"" mode, great feature to have in an easy to hit button- R side main button: single tap pauses whatever is playing, double tap jumps to next song, triple tap goes back- R side volume up and separate volume down buttons intuitively located- On button is also slide-and-hold for pairing: great feature that is impossible to do accidentally- USB-C charging- port to use hardwire cable to connect directly if you cannot understand the blueteeth thing or want to play something from a device that has no bluetooth or won't pair.Favorite feature: plug in the 2' hardwire cable (which has a tiny but good inline mic on it) and let it dangle or tuck in a shirt pocket: you now have a top quality, silent, noise cancelling headset with a good mic (without changing any mode, hitting buttons etc) that allows you to talk on the phone in bliss. Now instead of yelling at my kids to be quiet every 5 minutes that I'm on the phone, I just put these on and have a great phone call.In the small house that we live in these have made my life a lot better and allow me to let my kids run around loudly having fun at times when I just want some quiet, and when I would have otherwise made them tone it down.The only downside to know about is that these are effective enough to where you need to be careful not to use the noise cancelling when you have much going on that you need to pay attention to. For example: you would not hear your sink overflowing or a pot boiling over, I didn't hear my woodstove fire getting too hot the other day, you won't hear early warnings of kids having trouble (probably wouldn't hear choking etc but would still notice actual screaming nearby). You would still hear something break or a loud whack etc, but probably wouldn't hear a vehicle pull up in your driveway. It does to some extent take away a major ""sense"" so you can't use it as often as you might like.For those other times, like if your wife is cooking and can hear the kids for you if there is trouble, and you just want to relax, I feel like I would almost pay the purchase price of these per week that I got to use them it is so awesome.","February 16, 2024",AHXY35FZ3NHNVNYNIINCKSNQ3G7Q,True,47.0,Color: Black,Bose QuietComfort,0.1609330836711789,Positive,0.9974,Positive

I immediately notice that the Bose is FAR SUPERIOR in noise canceling and quality. In the cheaper pairs, I noticed some type of 'air pressure' in my ear that the noise canceling was producing. My guess is it was some kind of standing wave to mask/hide external noise. I really don't know, because I'm not educated in this specific technology. However, I do know for sure that when I put the Bose on, I don't notice anything except the external world noises completely vanishing without a trace. Also because the Bose pair doesn't have some weird air pressure masking/hiding external noises, I can hear the music better, louder, and clearer than the other pairs.Overall just very impressed with the stark difference in quality. In some cases, cheaper is better because you can't really tell the difference.

R21WQIUYAEKSFB,B0CCZ26B5V,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life...",George Dawson,5,I purchased these as an upgrade and a gift to a person who needed the sound cancellation feature. In trying them out I was still impressed by the sound quality and easy pairing with a smartphone. At times I have used just the sound cancellation mode with no music - like when trying to sleep in the daytime and blocking unwanted noise and dialogue. Battery life is impressive. I can walk for 5 days - a few miles a day and still have battery power left at the end of the week. The only feature I have not used yet is the microphone adapter.Downsides are basically expense and aesthetics. I am an old man and am used to using headphones rather than earbuds. I still maintain the headphones will give superior sound quality and noise cancellation. These headphones are about 30% more expensive than the QuietComfort 45s that I purchased 2 years ago. Impossible to say if there is a discernible difference in any dimensions of quality for that price increase.,"July 10, 2024",AGYTYDXQMREPRB33IBMD57AOITHA,True,3.0,Color: Black,Bose QuietComfort,0.2644444444444445,Positive,0.93,Positive

(I have airpod pro’s) I like the app Bose provides for enchantments for sound quality, registering your device keeps track of battery life status it gives you. Regardless these are 5/5 headphones. Bass is not the deepest, but it’s nice. Quality for sound 5/5. Oh left this part out, i like that i can turn off these headphones than my airpod max’s.

I can actually set where I want the noise cancellation for different levels. Also, it’s very easy to answer my phone and talk to people while I’m listening to audiobooks. That was the only disadvantage to my old pair I could never get them to answer the phone. This one just does it with the flick of my finger on the little button on the one headphone.

In an era where immersive audio experiences are becoming more common, the absence of this feature feels like a missed opportunity, especially considering the premium price of these headphones. For users who enjoy a 3D soundstage or a more engaging listening experience, this could be a significant downside, since you can get the Beats Studio Pro for about half of the price of these (on sale).Overall: While the comfort, sound quality, and style are strong points, the high price, lack of features, and outdated Bluetooth technology may be a downside for some users.","August 15, 2024",AEVWAE66OFSMFOFYPIN5ZORGG3CA,True,0.0,Color: Cypress Green,Bose QuietComfort,0.23757605820105818,Positive,0.9901,Positive

These headphones are a fantastic choice for music lovers and anyone needing reliable wireless headphones.Pros:Excellent Sound Quality: The JBL Pure Bass sound delivers rich, deep bass and clear highs, making my music, podcasts, and calls sound fantastic. The audio experience is immersive and enjoyable.Long Battery Life: With up to 76 hours of battery life, these headphones last for days on a single charge. This is perfect for long trips or extended use without worrying about recharging.Speed Charge: The speed charge feature is a lifesaver. Just a quick 5-minute charge gives me several hours of playback time, which is incredibly convenient when I'm in a hurry.Comfortable Fit: The over-ear design and cushioned ear cups provide a comfortable fit, even during extended listening sessions. The headphones are lightweight and don't cause any discomfort.Bluetooth 5.3: The Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity ensures a stable and strong connection with my device. Pairing is quick and seamless, and I haven't experienced any dropouts or lag.Intuitive Controls: The on-ear controls are easy to use, allowing me to adjust volume, change tracks, and take calls without needing to reach for my phone.Cons:No Active Noise Cancellation: While the passive noise isolation is decent, the addition of active noise cancellation would make these headphones even better for noisy environments.Overall, the JBL Tune 720BT Wireless Over-Ear Headphones are an excellent choice for anyone seeking high-quality sound, long battery life, and comfort.

I'd prefer a bit more bass and higher...., I don't want to say quality but rather range or frequency in sound maybe is more accurate. But for the cost they are definitely worth it and what you would expect that jbl would be selling you. If you want what I'm describing then go with the 770 or maybe even the live series. Haven't used the live series but I believe they would fit what I want better but I didn't care for the live ergonomics or style. However I knew what I was or believed I was giving up to gain what I felt were better ergonomics for me & my style & taste or preference.

However I've notice if I wear them longer than a half hour my ear do begin to get very warm.The padding is nice and compares about the same as the older style.I guess for the $79 is not bad, I'm a little disappointed that the sound isn't nearly as good/loud as my older jbl e45bt or as clear.I'm unaware if the still make the e series jbls but if they do you're probably better spending your money on them instead.I say this tune 720 is probably better for kids.","July 18, 2024",AEDIJE2SF3OZI5D57BBTQDM5QIUQ,True,1.0,Color: White,JBL Tune,0.1307878787878788,Positive,0.9099,Positive

I got them for Zoom meetings, Phone calls...maybe play music once in a while but not meant for that. Well.. Jeez! They sound pretty darn good. Bass is tight & deep, mids & highs are clean & shine without one taking over the other.Construction is fair. They are all plastic which makes them reeaally lightweight & flexible. They don't feel cheap but not high-end either. Connecting Bluetooth is hassle free & easy. Pleasant Voice prompts for functions as well as on & off. Fabric on Headband & earpads is soft. Doesn't isolate ambient noises all that great which, for me isn't so much a bad thing as I can hear the outside world to a degree when turned down. Turned to max volume. . Well, it could be a bit louder. It's not too bad tho. Loud enough to tune out from the outside world but won't hurt your ears or damage hearing while still being loud enough to enjoy music. Be nice if they turned up to 11 tho. My ears fit all the way inside the ear cups & don't touch inner wall where drivers are.For calls it would be nice if it were a little louder which does matter if the person on the other line is having mic issues or speaking further from their mic as they could be. For Zoom they sound just fine as hoped. They do NOT fold up.. One of the reasons I chose them. Folding headphone can be annoying in my opinion. These flex just right & form fit to the head for a snug fit that's not too tight... They also extend quite a bit.. They can easily fit larger heads. I don't have a small head & they fit perfectly not extended at all.With all that said, All in all.. These are a very nice sounding, cooshy set of headphones that won't break the bank.. could be about $20 cheaper considering what else is out there from other manufacturers & even Logitech its self. Are they worth the $? Yeah. I've got a few other headsets in the same price range meant for music enjoyment & general use.. These are easily in the same tier & on par with them in terms of sound & overall build quality... And those others don't have a foldable boom mic. A really nice plus & works quite well. With a mute button on it to boot. Im told I come across clear with no static.If these look like you might like to give them a try. Do it. It's what I did & I've been quite pleased with that decision.","March 13, 2023",AHJ4ZRBV2HFYBU5R6TVLXCXWBPFQ,True,45.0,Color: Graphite,Logitech Zone,0.16549740010946906,Positive,0.9991,Positive

R123MG16G0AT89,B09NBVS84T,1.0 out of 5 stars Lots of issues,disillusion,1,"I'm writing this review after using it 8+ hours daily for over two weeks now for work and personal time. After using it for this amount of time, I have come to really dislike this headset and plan to return it. I'm leaving this review so that others can understand what some of the issues I find with it are so they don't make the same mistake. I mostly wanted a wireless headset for casual gaming/music and also be able to use it for Zoom calls for work. The flip to mute mic was a nice added bonus and these looked cute. On top of that, all the reviews I could find at the time are mostly positive so I gave them a try.For appearance, comfort and range of connection, I'd give it 5 stars.For utility and what it's supposed to be for: audio, I'd give it negative stars if I could.Pros:1. Lightweight, comfortable, not bulky, audio quality is ok when it's on ""headphone"" mode2. Gorgeous color, I got mine in pink.3. Battery life. Charges quickly, can last 2 full days at least on one charge even if you use it all day.Cons:1. Bluetooth only. This part I found to be a problem in all bluetooth-only headsets. What this means is, the headset actually has 2 modes/channels of audio: a high quality, output ONLY channel for stereo music, and a very low quality, voice call optimized input/output voice channel. The headset can auto toggle between between these channels automatically but what this means is that it cannot be on both channels at once. In other words, if you need the mic in any way shape or form (e.g. you're in a discord voice channel), it will FORCE you to be in the low quality sound. So if you want to listen to music or have good audio playing from a game at the same time, it won't work. Or you can have good audio, but everytime you need to use the mic, it mutes your audio. My only work around for this was to use it as only audio out and use a separate desk mic for input.2. Really bad static on long meeting calls. Basically EVERY meeting that I've been in during these past two weeks that have lasted at least an hour, around the hour mark there starts to be static weaved in with any audio. Every time someone talks, every syllable of sound is accompanied by really bad static, and the static stops if the call is quiet. I basically have to restart my headset every time (and lose around 5-10s of audio from the call while I do this) and it'll be working good as new again. I read that this could occur if the device is low battery but my headset has never dipped below 60% battery on any of the occasions I've used it so I don't know what causes it.3. Does not work with zoom after laptop goes to sleep and wakes up. I noticed at the end of the work day, if I do not shut my laptop down completely and restart it before next use, Zoom will stop playing the audio to this headset. Strangely it will play sounds from other parts of the computer and Zoom settings show the mic is ""active"" but it doesn't actually play anything unless I restart the computer completely. It's been highly annoying to have to shut down and do a fresh boot of my work laptop every day for this.4. Auto shuts off if no audio detected for a period of time even if there is audio playing. So like most bluetooth devices, it will go to sleep if it thinks it's inactive for a while. Usually this is fine because if I'm listening to something on youtube or a music player it knows to stay connected even for hours at a time. However, for some specific applications, like Genshin for example, if Genshin is the ONLY source of audio playing (there's background music, and game characters talking), this headset thinks there's no audio so it will go to sleep for no reason every 15min or so and then I have to manually flick it back on, or I have to keep playing a youtube video in the background to keep it awake.As you can see this headset has a bunch of really ridiculous problems that destroy user experience. At this price point, it's a very disappointing buy. I don't recommend it at all unless you plan to only use it for one basic task (which even then, let's be honest, it probably will do a bad job at).","December 17, 2022",AEIRLH5X6ZYWXLFV4UDDBSLEZXTA,True,172.0,Color: Rose,Logitech Zone,0.06688692480359144,Positive,-0.9573,Negative

The headphones are extremely light and very cozy around the ear. I have big ears so a lot of headphones end up smashing them and hurts after a while. But these didn’t touch my ears at all.

R3TY106BMIOLQZ,B09NBVS84T,3.0 out of 5 stars Not bad,AJ,3,"I’ve tested these for the 10hr shift I work where I work in a call center, so calls are non-stop. It has pretty good battery life as 8hrs into my shift, I had 91% battery life left.Sound quality is good. At first my incoming calls sounded far away, but I just needed to increase my volume level.These are able to connect to another device, so I had my phone connected playing pandora station and when I’d get a call, the music would turn off and I’d get an alert for an incoming call that would auto-answer. The auto-answer is a function by my organization due to the phone system we use so I’m unsure on its capability to answer and hang up calls (haven’t tried it yet on my phone).Aesthetically, these are pretty but simple headphones. They are the most comfortable I’ve worn as the ear cushion doesn’t actually press on your ear but your ears fit inside. They do run big (head strap) or maybe I have a small head but that didn’t bother me.I can appreciate that it has a mute function when you lift up the mic, BUT what I don’t like is that once it’s muted you don’t hear anything at all. Other headsets that I’ve used, when the mic is muted, it only muted your mic so the caller couldn’t hear you, but with these, it also mutes the caller so I can’t hear what they are saying which was annoying. So you and the caller are sitting in silence together . If there is a way around this, that would be great.Programs that I use are Teams, Outlook, and a phone system for inbound calls and it works fine.Unfortunately, I’m going to return because I don’t like that mute feature which is a non-negotiable for me.","May 20, 2024",AGTIRDTPWEBROCC7J27ZRH5CDCXQ,True,12.0,Color: Rose,Logitech Zone,0.13947368421052628,Positive,0.9708,Positive
R3MUUQ7EMQHHCA,B09NBVS84T,5.0 out of 5 stars MULTIPOINT!!!,Bret,5,"I will never go back to any headset that does not have this feature ever again!This devices seamlessly switches between my work mac book pro, my iPhone, and my gaming computer. It does only connect to 2 devices at once, so I typically have to disconnect it from my work laptop and then connect it to my gaming computer. This is super easy because when I am done for the day at work, I just close the lid and throw it in my backpack. That disconnects it form the headset right there, and then it automatically connects back up with the next device it has connected to being my personal computer.Sound quality is great, and the materials should hold up for quite a while. The over ear design make them comfortable to wear for long periods of time.I especially like the lift up mic with auto mute. I spend quite a bit of time on zoom meetings as our company is mostly full remote, so I can leave zoom un-muted and just flip up the mic to mute myself. Or if I really want to make sure no one hears what I am saying I could mute zoom and the mic! It is a pain to remember I am double muted though so I almost never do it.I can wear these through my entire work day listening to music from my phone, or joining zoom meetings on my computer. Which leads me to another great feature of these headphones. I listen to music during down time, and I have to listen to that music from my phone. But I also wanted a solution that I could take work calls from my work laptop without having 2 headsets. Multi-point solves this problem. When I am listening to music from my phone and I get a zoom phone call, or join a zoom meeting, the music from my phone is automatically paused, and then the laptop audio takes over. I have my meeting / phone call and then after it ends, the music from my phone automatically unpauses and the music resumes!I cannot say enough about this headset, If anyone I know has a need for a headset I recommend this. And if the time came that I needed a new headset I would hands down buy this product again.","August 13, 2023",AFH3LFFCA7GDZOYTJY5A2TUNJ46Q,True,25.0,Color: Graphite,Logitech Zone,0.15343867243867246,Positive,0.9505,Positive

RVBDAGBIOELXS,B09NBVS84T,3.0 out of 5 stars Mic Noise Cancelation is False,Whitney,3,"Once I opened the box, I noticed I did not receive the baggie or the USB-C charger (the box explains that it includes those items), it was also at 20% battery when I turned it on, which tells me that I was sent a used product...The ear cushions are comfy and very bearable to wear for a good amount of time.The pink model is super cute.The Mic mutes when rotated up and unmutes when rotated down.However, the main reason for purchasing was the noise-canceling mic for the sake of working from home. I performed a test by calling myself from my work phone, the voicemail left on my cell phone had everything in the background playing, from the TV to the toddler.I am unsure if it would allow me to download the LogiTune app to my work PC, I did not attempt to download it.However, I did test the LogiTune app on my personal laptop by using Google Voice to leave myself a voicemail and no matter how I configured the settings, sidetone, or mic level, it still heard everything in the background.Logitune also allows you to control how long the headset stays on before it goes into sleep mode, which you can set to ""never sleep"".Perhaps because it is Bluetooth only and does not offer a dongle is the reason it is not able to truly suppress noise cancelation, but I will be returning these. I have noticed that my headsets with USB chip connections offer the noise suppression setting on Windows PCs.Overall, I am not satisfied with these.","February 4, 2024",AHYTHYLTI4VQMJQ26OQ4HI4UUV4A,True,2.0,Color: Rose,Logitech Zone,0.06818181818181818,Positive,-0.1533,Negative

I will not compare to my professional headphones, but for videocalls is fine.Now, speaking of videocalls, which is why I chose this product, it has given me a hard time in terms of reliability. I can use them all day with a single charge for audio listening (music, Youtube, etc.) but as soon as I connect to Teams calls, the problems begin.I have detected a trend.If it is a short call: no issuesIf it is a long call (more than 30 min), then seems like the Bluetooth buffer starts to fill or something happens at a software level. The call starts to sound cut, as if the internet connection failed. A quick manual power-off/power-on (without even ending the call) and it fixes the issue.Unfortunately most of my calls are longer than 30 minutes, and had to stop using this device and go back to wired until I find something better.

RC2KF4ZQ2Q9WZ,B09NBVS84T,"4.0 out of 5 stars They are great but Windows 11 users, be aware.",Ruben Rojas,4,"EDIT: If you're using Windows, just avoid them until they fix their issue with Bluetooth headsets. I've heard Android and Mac computers (not iPhones tho) don't have this issue, I cannot assure that. Just get any wireless headset with a wireless dongle, avoid this or any Bluetooth headset if you want to do anything else than office video calls.--They're nice. They're wireless, battery lasts all day, music sounds nice*, they're lightweight and comfortable, this coming from someone with a big head. They look professional, they're Bluetooth so no extra dongles occupying more USB real estate......But.Since Windows 11 takes it as a single device (instead of headphones + microphone), every time I'm going to use the mic for a videocall or gaming, Windows changes its profile to Hands-free headset, and there sound is AWFUL. It's like using a cheap wireless headset in your phone for calls. Forget about listening any music in the background apart from lo-fi, because it really turns into lo-fi mode.Maybe it was my fault for getting the cheaper, no dongle version (I don't know if getting the receiver solves this, though), and certainly Microsoft is more to blame than Logi on this one, but it happens and it really ruins the experience.I still like them, I just avoid listening music whenever I'm at call, and as soon as I leave them Windows change its mode automatically so I can play music again, but if you're looking for something for serious gaming or so, stick to the wireless 2.4 GHz ones. At least until Microsoft-Logi get their stuff together.","November 24, 2022",AGKFZYC42GZITI56SCRMPDZABX4Q,True,45.0,Color: Graphite,Logitech Zone,0.12552910052910055,Positive,-0.7151,Negative

Battery life is good, lasts about 3-4 work days without a needing to recharge. Wish the noise cancellation was more of an active noise cancellation but it's pretty much only on the mic side while talking to someone.HOW ever... I bought these specifically for the multipoint blue tooth connection and while I got them connected there are several issues I cannot get past. One connected computer sounds fine, the other sounds like the audio is playing in a hallway (echoey). When I pause a video on the second computer randomly between 20-40 seconds it will begins playing again and takes over the audio on the headset from the 1st bluetooth connection. Also the built-in software focuses your audio to just the call your on with no way of disabling that function. I do slack calls with video/audio screen sharing and if I play a video with audio the headset disables the ability to hear anything outside of the call even in windows. This REALLY should be a togglable switch in the Logitune software but nothing as of 6/26/2024.

The audio good, the mic is good, the joints however are creaky. With use, this may become less of an issue but at the moment it's driving me a bit bonkers.

I've gently flexed the joints but so far that has not changes any thing. I may try to work a small amount of silicone grease (safe for plastic) into the joints.

The battery lasts for the 4-5 hours I use them, and I haven't run into many problems with the microphone just yet, even on 4 hour calls. I will also say the range for connectivity is very impressive, when I'm about 25 feet away they tend to have a very solid connection.Overall if you are trying to stay cheap, they are a must have.Major con however, you should 100% use their application for headphone control to modify the microphone's mute settings because I have noticed that the flip to mute microphone sometimes wont work.

They became useless. They were just badly made and the seller didn't offer to replace them because it was over 30 days. I went to Logitech who wouldn't help because I bought them from a third party seller. There is no quality control anymore. I now use a cheap pair of earbuds that I plug into my computer that I got free on an airplane. They work so much better and I don't have to worry about being disconnected. Do not buy these headsets. They stop working right after the return time is up.

R2FJ8ADHX38QOP,B09NBVS84T,1.0 out of 5 stars Mute does not work as advertised,Hailey McClatchy,1,"I excitedly purchased this headset during the July Prime Days in 2023 and I'm finally getting Logitech to resolve my issue in October of 2023. The headset is comfortable and sound quality isn't terrible BUT the real issue is with the mute function.I specifically bought this headset because of the ""rotate to mute"" function and the color. I often prefer to ""inline"" mute myself without actually having to click the microphone icon within the meeting I'm in. With this headset, when you mute the mic, either with the ""rotate to mute"" function or the mute button on the mic boom, all the audio is muted as well. That means you cannot mute your own mic while still hearing the meeting audio. It's a real problem when you're teaching or demoing software all day and you'd like to just quickly mute to sneeze or cough but still hear what your client is saying to you. Muting yourself with the button in the meeting tells other meeting attendees that you've muted and can often distract them or lead them to believe you're not paying attention. That's why inline mute is one of my baseline requirements for a headset.If you happen to bring this issue to Logitech, first they're going to tell you ""It's just a defect with that particular headset"" and instruct you to get a replacement from Amazon. Then, when that new headset has the exact same problem, they're going to drag their feet for 3 full months before finally offering to send you a model that does not have this defect but tell you you cannot have it in the original color you purchase (even though that color option is available).I've been really disappointed in Logitech support through this whole ordeal. I've never had such a terrible experience with their support team. They keep trying to insist that it's a one-off or user error and it's not actually that they're selling a product that doesn't work as advertised. If I hadn't sunk so much money and time into this, I'd have just thrown in the towel by this point.Save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different brand. I'd say pay for the upgraded models but then you'd still be giving money to this crappy company.","October 6, 2023",AG6CHYYZK7FEO7C2I42EOEQWF3MQ,True,7.0,Color: Rose,Logitech Zone,0.05412457912457914,Positive,-0.6962,Negative

Here are the pros and cons:Pros:The battery still lasts up to 10 hours, mainly during meetings (not sure about music or other types of usage).Cons:1- Using it with your phone can be frustrating. For example, if you switch from speaker to the Zone Vibe 100 during a call, there's at least a 5-second silence on both the speakers and the headset. It's annoying.2- During long calls, you'll randomly hear a noise that gets louder until you can't hear others on the call. The only way to fix this is to turn it off and on again, which means losing audio for another 5 to 10 seconds.3- Its USB dongle has a shorter range compared to your computer or phone Bluetooth.I had the Logitech Zone, and it was a night-and-day difference.

These headphones are an excellent choice for anyone looking for quality sound without breaking the bank.Sound Quality:The sound quality is outstanding, especially for the price point. The XBS (Extra Bass System) delivers deep, rich bass that enhances my listening experience, whether I'm enjoying music, podcasts, or audiobooks. The clarity across the mids and highs is impressive, making these headphones perfect for various genres.Comfort:One of the standout features of these headphones is their lightweight design. They are incredibly comfortable to wear for extended periods, which is essential for me during long listening sessions. The ear pads are soft and cushioned, providing a snug fit without causing any discomfort.Portability:These headphones are also very portable. Their compact design makes them easy to carry in my bag, and they don’t take up much space, which is a bonus for travel. The adjustable headband ensures a secure fit, whether I’m at home or on the go.Durability:While lightweight, the build quality feels solid. I’ve used them regularly, and they have held up well against daily wear and tear. I appreciate that they are designed to last, making them a worthwhile investment.Overall Experience:In summary, I highly recommend the Panasonic On-Ear Lightweight Headphones with XBS RP-HT21 for anyone seeking a combination of comfort, sound quality, and affordability.

R1SV8ME3OXDM4Q,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing price/performance ratio,Amazoner,5,"These headphones are not only very light and comfortable, the sound is just simply amazing. They easily rival headphones that cost 4x-10x the price (e.g. Koss Porta-Pro, Senheiser). You wouldn't expect such a well-rounded sound with good bass from such unassuming headphones. The sound can be described as warm, with good heavy bass rendering, similar to the famous Koss Porta-Pro (that retails for $40), and is good for modern music (with heavy drums, bass, and electronic sounds), and baritone male voices (i.e. NPR talk radio). The sound profile is like the older warm analog 70's amplifiers like Sansui and Denon. The sound signature is the familiar round, not harsh, well-balanced, Panasonic sound, which, by the way, is the maker of the sound systems used in luxury Acura cars. This means you can wear and listen to music with these headphones for hours without tiring, both physically and mentally. Construction-wise, they are well-built, made of various soft and hard plastics and rubber-like material. They are quite sturdy, and take a beating without breaking, which is useful when travelling. The price is simply a steal: they currently retail for $8! There are, and never have been, no other headphones with such amazing sound can be bought at this price, bar none.","August 2, 2024",AFPVRHPKP3OMIFGPZSBZB6HAW6WQ,True,5.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.21399621212121211,Positive,0.9817,Positive
R25JYEOK3T4X34,B075LT8YLR,4.0 out of 5 stars Panamazing!,WeStayOldSchool,4,"Ok so before I start my well-detailed review on this product, let me first state I am NOT getting paid for doing this review, NEITHER do I work for Panasonic, I'm doing this purely out of enjoyment and to help anyone else interested in buying this product, as I'm just a teenager into music and quality headphones. Let's go into we look for into a pair of headphones:- Sound Delivery- Bass- Quality of crisp, and clear sound- Convenience- Comfort- Durability- Size- Look/DesignNote: I'll also be comparing this product to my Replica Beats By Dre Minis, ($10) and my Sony MDRZX-100 Heaphones (Paid about $14, now going for $15-$16). Also, I'll be grading this product on the factors of comparison to my other headphones and price.Sound Delivery aka loudness of the sound: Beat my beats. However, these may be right at, or slightly less loud than my sonys. Grade: 8.5/10Bass: Dominated my beats. sonys and these were a bit harder, but although these barely sounded less loud than the sonys, it knocked out the competition in bass, very surprised! Grade: 10/10Quality of sound: It blew the beats completly out the water! Sony and these were very close, until I realized the difference finally doing both sound and bass hip hop songs as test demos. Once again, the panasonic headphones are victorious! This was much of a unexpected surprise of delivery to me too, as of the price, and how the sound of these are not muddy at all like my rep beats, and ridiculously clear and crisp output noise. Grade: 11/10Convenience: Although I didn't go to a gym, i ran in place and shook my head around pretty hard while listening to music, no volume change, nor did they come off at all, as I actually thought they would. Can be used as gym headphones, and are surprisingly, more lightweight than imagined. Weighs less than all headphones, possibly 1/3 almost 1/4 the weight of my sonys! Can use at school, road trips, or exercise as i confidently feel as well, moisture and sweat won't be a factor in them coming off ears while working out since they are made out of foam on the ear cups.Won't weigh down neck or hands at all, even for the fatigue or elderly/crippled. Can extend like my other two pairs of headphones although, can't fold up like rep beats not a big deal however, didn't really expect them to be able to fold. Grade: 10/10Comfort: Probably the lowest grade I'm going to give for these headphones. Unfortunately the foam is a bit rough and irritates my ears and itches after about five minutes, no allergic reactions or side effects though, so don't worry. It is forgivable due to its portability, but not ascomportable as sonys nor my rep beats, although they won't make your ears sore like my rep beats while using. Doesn't feel like pins and needles, though. Grade: 5/10Durability: Another and final flaw to this product, that makes these so inexpensive. Keep in mind I just received mine today, and MAY do an update in maybe a month or two, but it lacks durability I can tell. Although on the outside it seems like solid plastic, the inside you see otherwise, if you flick or mess with it a little. If you drop it in your house, shouldn't be a biggie, although outside on cement may scuff, scratch, or probably break your headphones varying on how hard and stepping on the cord and to what momentum they fling or collide with the ground at. Would not throw them at the ground (obviously), or trust little kids with them really. Keep in mind, if you keep the delicateness, be careful, and take good care of them to mind, this shouldn't be a factor to take into place when purchasing. If your reckless with objects, I do not recommend. Grade: 4/10Size: Although not you average size headphones, I mentioned you are buying this headphones for the light size, plus I favor the small size compared to my others. Grade: 10/10Look: I was debating, If I should include this to my total star grade and overall grade, but I decided no and this is just an extra detail. They are not fancy nor colorful like beats by dre, DJ headphones, sonys, or some of other headphones/earphones. however, you are aware from pictures of the color and what they look like, so I realized that people know what they look like, as well it's not about if they look as cool as beats or not, it's mainly bang for buck. Nice normal oval design on ear cups though as they could be square and wacky like other headphones. Grade: 7/10Overall I'd recommend these to anyone looking for amazing headphones that are inexpensive. Overall grade I'd give these is an 84 percent or a B. For their price though, overall I'd give them 105 percent or an A+. Would suggest the quality comparable to some high end $25 headphones, and would pay for them at a store as high as $29.99 and tax, if they were just a bit more durable and comfortable. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing these, to anyone looking for really good bass and sound delivery headphones that takes decent care of their stuff.","April 30, 2016",AEJG5K5MUQ4DU7LWBH4TLX573EKA,True,122.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.12017402945113788,Positive,0.9978,Positive
R2DV19SUJ3ZQS1,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones for the price...,Thomas Glebe,5,"Stereo headphones have come a long way over several decades, and there have been so many advances, it's often hard to keep up with the latest technologies. In the beginning, there was basically only ONE type, that of being, the completely over the ear, studio-type and others. As things progressed, ""earbuds"" of many types began to be offered and an expensive type of these have emerged, with the advent of the I-Pod and various other portable CD and MP3 players. I've never really liked these, as no matter how much one spends, they still have to snugly and comfortably fit the individual's ears, which is no small task, as all human ears are not created equal. Fortunately, various forms of the original concept of over-ear, noise-canceling headphones have kept pace with the earbud variety. Some of these are more completely over the ear than others, some are more or less outside noise-canceling types, and then there are the cheapest non-earbud types, which can vary greatly in concept and overall quality.For the best experience in private listening, one needs to spend at least $50 these days, if not upwards of $100 or more. However, these type of stereo headphones are usually very large and are not really suited to portable, on the go listening. Still, they do not suffer from the earache of buds, and usually produce the best overall, robust sound. In between most earbud types and most larger ""monitor"" types, there are so many varieties nowadays, that the general, plug-in stereo-headphones shopper is usually left quite confused when trying to pick out a suitable, high-quality model, at a reasonable price. For almost all purposes, this is a really good buy, and I give them high marks in just about every headphone category one can think of or desire. And the asking price is a bargain.One little caveat however. The Amazon ""product description"" and even mentioned in a review or two, state that the cord length is nearly 10 feet. I think this must be referring to some earlier model or just a mistake, because the cord length of these is only about 6 feet total. While this does not interfere with my personal use or intentions of use before I even bought a pair, sound unheard, I think this should be pointed out. The difference between a 10-foot cord length and a 6 foot one is rather substantial. Therefore, these are in no way suitable for ""roaming the room"" or dancing ""to your heart's content,"" as the Amazon product description states. Amazon should correct this product description. If one desires more than a six-foot cord length however, a cheap extension can always be purchased for a few bucks at Radio Shack and the like. It's a 6 foot cord though, not 10.Outside of this however, these are really great headphones for the price, and offer terrific sound and value. While they are ""fold-able"" in a way, this only applies somewhat, as they are not completely so, and attempts at making the set truly small for carrying purposes might only break them. While they are ""over-the-ear,"" they are not entirely of the more expensive, truly ""noise-canceling"" variety, though they do a fair job at this, again, for the price. The earphones are padded and the set is nicely adjustable for nearly all head sizes, unless you have the head size of a mouse or Eraserhead. Extended use is no problem, once you easily adjust them to comfortably fit personally. That is, wearing these for hours will not cause any real head/ear strains or pains, either during use or afterwards, volume levels and adjustments aside.These tend to lean heavily towards the bass frequencies and are enhanced to do so, although the mid-range and upper-ranges come through very good as well. Still, since there is no equalizer function, it helps that whatever source you will be listening to with these, can be adjusted itself. That is, if you are using these to listen to a CD or MP3 player, it helps that you are able to use an equalizer at the source, since again, the bass response here is emphasized. I use these mainly for the computer, and my CD/MP3 player on that is fully adjustable as far as regulating highs, mids, and lows, so the extra bass is no problem. Still, even if one is not able to adjust low and mid and high end frequencies on your player source, the overall sound is excellent on generally all forms of music and sounds, and the stereo separation between left and right is, well, right on.I have always had a generally good experience with Panasonic products, and that includes higher-end, higher priced headphones from them. While these are rather cheaply made and fragile, if you take care of them and don't ask them to do what they are clearly not intended to do, you will be pleasantly surprised. A definite bonus is the small volume control on the cord. This comes in real handy at times, since not all music is recorded and produced at the same volume level, and this control allows one to raise or lower the volume without touching the source player. And again, while these headphones are not really suited for any long life with heavy abuse, and might seem too ""cheaply"" made for some, taking care during use negates any such negatives and I would guess these will last and perform well just about as long as you want them to.I bought two pair of these, which got me free shipping, and I really can't complain. They are great for plugging into one's computer, or using with any CD/MP3 player with an equalizer, but generally, they perform well for just about any purpose as far as headphones go. They also fit nicely and comfortably as a ""necklace"" during breaks in listening. One can easily buy much better headphones, but for the price, these offer remarkable sound at an easily affordable price, and I recommend them highly.","January 8, 2009",AG57W6SE26BZPR5NS7OCGFEET3EQ,True,303.0,Size: One SizeStyle: On Ear - With Volume Control,Panasonic Headphones,0.1912955729166666,Positive,0.9968,Positive

The only issue is the 1/8 stereo tip will not fit most phone cases. The diameter of the plug is 3/8 inch round and does not have the step that fits into those small holes so it will not seat fully into your phone.

Not very user friendly for people with old tired eyes. Not me, of course, I'm just sayin'.

R199408W85H0D,B075LT8YLR,3.0 out of 5 stars Uniquely unimpressive,Chris Cantwell,3,"These are cheap over ear headphones. That is what I wanted, and that is what I got. I won't be returning them, but I would not buy again at any price.The Good1. They are cheap2. I like the way they fit over my head in that they are comfortable and do not leave a big gap between the band and my head, as other headphones I have do, which makes them visually better on camera than some alternatives. (I am a live streamer)3. They are actual over ear headphones. Too many headphones marketed as over ear are actually large on ear headphones. These completely go over the ears.This is a decidedly exhaustive list of their merits.The Bad1. Not only do these not cancel noise, they have an odd way of making it worse. I have fans running on my room, and with the headphones on, even if the volume is turned all the way down or I unplug them, something about these headphones is like listening to a sea shell, it's like a sound trap wind tunnel and it is ridiculous.2. Bass is negligible. I suspect these over ear versions are just the on ear versions in different packaging. I've never had over ear headphones sound so crummy before.3. Though they actually go over ear, they do not press firmly against the head, hence the failure to cancel any noise.4. Feels like cheap plastic, I expect them to break. The reason I wanted cheap over ear headphones for this application was because they are intended for my mobile broadcasting kit and the circumstances of travel often destroys equipment. I like to have easily replaced equipment for this purpose, since I don't want to be stressing out about breaking something expensive. I suspect these will break sooner than others.5. The ones I got did not come with a 3.5mm to 1/4"" adapter and I had to use my own.I bought them as ""Used - Good"" on Amazon, and they arrived with the packaging gone on one and damaged on the other, but the headphones were in visually perfect condition. They function identically which tells me there is nothing unique to these particular units causing this.If you want the cheapest over ear headphones on Amazon, I think these are it. You'll be able to hear the things you want to hear for the most part, as long as you don't need superb quality to be very discriminating.If that's what you want, that is what you will get when you purchase these.If you want anything better than that, don't buy these.","October 14, 2023",AEZJYI3WNWFBUKTXHY5HTG5YVVNQ,True,8.0,Size: 4.1x 7.2x 7.6Style: Over Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.20099352599352605,Positive,0.8688,Positive

R38UZALPJKKQDB,B075LT8YLR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Cost effective, durable, and compact",Amazon Customer,5,When my Sony headphones started to wear out I was looking for something that would suit my needs and not break the budget. I chose the Panasonic set because the reviews were favorable and there was no buyers remorse. After approximately 3 weeks of use I can make a general assessment. The sound quality is very good. What I have noticed is that in listening to music this set of headphones showcases various aspects of the sound quality. This is particularly identifiable in the mid-range areas. It does not have the window rattling over powering bass that some may prefer. By having a heavy emphasis on bass the sensitive listener will not hear the softer sounds of flutes or light percussion that the Panasonic headphones can do.

RIA85YWZ9S2T5,B075LT8YLR,"4.0 out of 5 stars Highly recommend! Sound great! They won't last you for ever, but they do outlast other headphones of the price point.",Aaron,4,"These sound great. They're indeed very light weight. They have a gentle fit so don't hurt your ears squeezing them against the sides of your head etc. They're a lot like the old time Sony Walkman style headphones that came with those little cassette players.They're probably fairly durable, but I wear these for hours every single day. I buy 3 or so at a time and unbox the next one when I finish the one I'm wearing off. The quickest I've ever finished one off was around 3 weeks, but they usually last 4 months or so.The bass is there, but not overpowering. It's just right, not too much mid, and not too much high. I'm blind so my computer is talking to me constantly when I'm using it. I'm also profoundly deaf, so wear behind the ear hearing aids. These fit well against the aids if I turn them around backward. The downside to that is the stereo field is reversed. The flat pads on these don't try to wrap around your ear or cancel out environmental sound. They are very gentle in terms of causing hearing aids to experience feedback. I can wear them for many hours without getting tired of having them on. They don't press the backs of my ear against the aid and produce sore spots and the like.The cable is not overly thick, not ridiculously thin either - probably just about right for the price. The plug is an l shaped, sticks out of your device about 1 cm before the 90 degree turn, then the sleeve ends 7/8th of an inch. The wire splits about 14 inches from the earphones with a little plastic gizmo that does not slide up or down. It sends one wire to each earphone.The earphones are on a slide thing that's in the headband, you can slide them out for a bigger head. I always keep them all the way slid in, that's the best fit for my hearing aids. All the way slid in, worn backward with the headband tilted way forward and nearly on my forehead. If it sounds weird it's because it is, but it works, and works for many hours every day.If I want to complain, it would be that I kind of wish they had a straight plug, with a short jacket on it, and I wish they had an integrated decent quality microphone. I've driven myself crazy trying to find a headset that looks sort of like these do, has flat pads, sounds ok, will sit on my hearing aids, etc, etc, while having a microphone that, a: doesn't have a short and allow the person on the other end to hear my computer talking as though it's actually their computer talking, even though I'm freaking wearing headphones, and b: refuse to sound decent.The most common failure point for these have been one or the other of the earphones will become quieter. Once or twice one will completely stop working and I can affect it by pushing the cord up into the bottom of that earphone, but usually it just grows quieter. This is most often after a few hundred hours of usage though, and I'm not disappointed. For the price, I honestly don't think these can be beat in terms of durability and sound quality. They're above average any way I slice it for sound quality. They won't hold up against Bowse and the like but they're quite impressive anyhow.","June 28, 2017",AFMM6RGMYSPYN5FJNYGWX5ENM5VA,True,14.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.13657706093189964,Positive,0.9818,Positive

R2DT7S9W8ROASQ,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Bang For Your Buck,Stephen R. Finney,5,"If you want value for your money, if you lose your headphones too often, if you wear out the cord, or plug on your headphones, these are the ones to get. I have a couple of MP3 players I use at work daily and with them I wear my headphones constantly. I either lose or wear them out whether they are more expensive or cheaper. I was absolutely startled at the bass that came our of these phones. It is deep, rich and accurate. Overall sound is better than a pair I once had that cost me about 10 times as much. Knowing that I would either wear them out or lose them I bought 4 pairs this time. I will definitely buy more when the need arises. An excellent deal, I highly recommend these phones.****UPDATE 9 July 2016*****After 10 years my opinion of these headphones hasn't done anything but get better. I just wore out a pair that I've been using for at least 2 or 3 years, so it's time to buy some more. Still the best bang for your buck. I still give a pair away from time to time, and my original recommendation stands. Great Phones! It is the 14th of October 2019, and I just took out a fresh pair of these headphones for a trip to Idaho. The old ones, probably a year or so old, are still functioning. I'm still thunderstruck at the overall quality of sound from the HT-21s. The base is amazing, and accurate. My ears need as much treble as possible which these do deliver. After 13 years since this review was originally published, I still haven't found anything better. At the current price, give them a try. It's not like you'd be out for much more than the price of a breakfast at McDonalds.Last update December 15, 2023It's been about 18 years, or more since I bought my first pair of these headphones. I dont use them as much since I'm now retired, but my opinion hasn't changed. I still haven't found headphone that offer as much value based upon amazing sound for a very low price. I have 2 spare pairs put away should I need to replace the pair that's out for use.

R2XBHJ0SU75ZLI,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars These sound great. A deal at thrice the price.,N. Bell and K. Johnson,5,"Forget for a minute that these are under 7 bucks.I purchased these headphones primarily because I needed some cheap cans that would allow me to play video games and still hear what is going on around me in the real world. Xbox One now supports Windows Sonic, a surround-soundifier for headphones, and I wanted to take advantage of that. Figured these would be less isolating than my earbuds or over-ear Skullcandys, and the price was right. I didn't have much expectation beyond that.TLDR version: These sound way better than I expected.It has been a few years since I had a heaphone of this design, a lower-end ""came with your '90s Walkman or CD portable"" on-ear type. Both the very best and very worst I've owned were made by Sony, and if my aural memory serves, these are much closer to the good ones. Bass is not super-powerful but there's certainly enough low-end thump to make video games sound satisfying. From guns and explosions in Wolfenstein II, to thunder and horse-hoof beats in Oblivion, these are more than adequately bassy for a sense of realism. I can listen thru these quite happily without wishing for my larger and bassier Skullcandys. Upper-bass and lower mids are smooth and warm, never honky. Upper-mids and treble are airy, if a teensy bit over-emphasized. I don't mind that, as it makes dialogue and quiet passages in music easier to hear at low volume.I've been mostly listening to electronic chill and ambient thru these, with a few classical tunes here-and-there. No complaints. Bass is, again, not mind-blowing, but just enough for low strings, low brass, drums, and various electronic bloops and bleeps. Stereo imaging is great, seeming to extend well beyond the boundaries of my head. I think this helps the illusion of 5.1 surround when listening to Windows Sonic. Rain in the game Oblivion sounds like it's really falling all around me, and the voices of various characters walking around the game all come from distinct points in space. Shows like Stargate Universe on DVD and Battlestar Galactica on Amazon Prime sound similarly spectacular. I would say the sense of surrounding space is more realistic with these than with my earbuds, and the fact that I can still hear my loved ones around me while listening is a great bonus.I can't find too much fault with these. Hard rock and hip-hop might sound a bit thin and screechy through these headphones, especially when cranked to eleven. The plug might be too fat to fit through some phone cases, so use an extender or remove your case for portable listening. Build quality is not phenomenal, but as long as you're not stuffing them in a backpack or gym bag, and treating them like a grown adult should, they will last quite a while.These would be great to wear while walking around a park, while shopping, or anywhere else where you want your tunes with you but still want to hear what's going on in the real world.Ok, now we can talk about the price. Holy crap, 7 bucks??? They're worth at least 20. Score one for Panasonic!

R2YUW9VOHHURDI,B075LT8YLR,4.0 out of 5 stars Ear buds and over-the-ear are uncomfortable for me...these are comfortable...,Bruce,4,"...I wouldn't go jogging with them but for the gym and home it's fine. Like any piece of electronic equipment with thin wires you can't treat it roughly and not pull it from a device using the wires only or yank it around in any way considering the connection points are not reinforced. Certainly considering the price the sound is decent. I played in a dance band and had a short stint in a studio, so I have at least a vague idea as to how a speaker should or can sound considering pricing. You want to bitch, get a Bose or one of the other high-end units. If I accidentally break it, I'm not going to cry about it, I'll just get another one. I can understand being pissed if it doesn't work out of the box (so to speak), but send it back and get another one. This does happen when you are making hundreds of thousands of units. Some individuals are so spoiled. There are no bells and whistles, but it works. And anyone that expects an inexpensive on-ear to be noise cancelling while having extraordinary frequency range in a single speaker needs a saliva test. I had one 4 times as expensive and the sound was about the same. Sometimes cheap ain't all that bad. If you are an ""audiophile,"" maybe an over-the-ear like a Bose may be right for you, but I have found them heavy, bulky, hot, ill-fitting and generally uncomfortable. I haven't found one yet that was comfortable. Yes, hooking these up to a high-end audio system would be a waste but for a computer or gym these are fine.","July 15, 2022",AGUHES2MPOTR7VZB7WAXGAEWHVAA,True,10.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.018033509700176375,Positive,-0.5697,Negative

But for me they do what I need them to doEach pair has lasted me between 6-12 months, depending on how many times I accidentally yank the cord--they really hold up to a LOT of abuse, the wires inside not breaking for ages and ages. The spongy ear covers stay on! That is a huge plus. But they can be removed for cleaning, and I've kept them from all my old pairs, so I have backup if I want to take them off and clean one set. They' rea not extremely fluffy or cushioning, but they do the job.The end of the cord is an elbow. The over-the-top part is adjustable, and I don't have a problem with them readjusting/sliding on their own.I only listen to text-to-speech or audio books and, as long as the speakers don't go in and out (as all headphones do when the cords get broken inside) I am happy. I use these to listen to books overnight. I need something that just plugs into my Victor Reader Stream and does nothing else. Since I wear these all night long, 365 days a year, a predominant side-sleeper, the way they fit onto my head needs to be flat enough that they don't bother my ears or head, and in all the years I've been using these they only have a handful of times, when I've REALLY fallen hard asleep (we're talking drool, pillow face creases, the whole deal). I also wear a CPAP, and these don't interfere with that headgear.The only con for me is that they've changed the cord to being a sort of rubbery material instead of the older ""slippery"" one, so it sticks a bit instead of the smooth glide they've had all the previous years. That makes it harder to pull them out form under me when I flip over. I miss that slippery cord a LOT.If they are the same style and quality as the last 5 times I've bought them then I'll be just as happy this 6th time.","April 19, 2021",AGU4DKNRT2HPLYHGT3GV522HSJBQ,True,1.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.11964285714285716,Positive,0.6522,Positive

This was my initial review.I can add a few comments to those. They still do not promote ear-canal infections, so good. They are very lightweight, also good. Inexpensive, obviously good. Fidelity is voice-only. They are good for listening to podcasts. Music reproduction is poor-to-mediocre, with a tinny mid-range, little bass, and strident last octave. It also sounds outright distorted, which is strange, coming from a headphone.Construction: The plastic headband is surprisingly robust, given that I have laid on it with my head and not broken it. The cheap little foam pads will fail first, based on experience. The cord is annoying. It comes off the bottom of the phones, and is joined below the neck. This is a recipe for tangles, and I am very careful to avoid twisting it. The right-angle plug is essentially a hook, and snags on everything, and has to always be rotated when plugged-in so the cord is pointing in the right direction. Panasonic- change this to a straight plug.Usage: I often use them while laying in bed, and the ear plugs were better for that except for the ear-canal infections. The phones are too thick to allow me to lay on my side. I will have to look for thinner phones.","November 22, 2023",AGILDR3YBATOVZOFV3HUNFAUX5NA,True,10.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.13283812341504653,Positive,0.9692,Positive

R1RZWZD907X416,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones for the price! Wires need strain relief at the speakers. Foam cushions not needed.,DarthRad,5,"I've been using these headphones for about a decade or more now.The first one I had broke fairly quickly, because the headphone has a fundamental design flaw with its very thin and delicate wires and no strain relief where the wires enter the speakers (the 3.5mm plug side does have strain relief between the wire and the plug, if you are wondering what that term means and looks like). So what breaks these headphones is that any movement causes these wires to get yanked and torqued around this pivot/anchor point where they enter the speakers, and that's where they break inside the insulation.So with the next several of the headphones I bought, I decided to add my own strain relief to these wires, by applying glue to this juncture. The best type of glue to use is one with some elasticity, like shoe goop or E6000, as they are now marketing it. PVC pipe cement (or model airplane cement) also works, but once this glue get old and hardened, the constant torquing will cause the glue joint to crack at the joint. But PVC glue does work and I have a lot of PVC cement around and it is easy to apply and re-apply.The second problem with these headphones is that the foam cushions have no anti-oxidation resistance and quickly turn into dust after a couple or years or so of exposure to ordinary air. Apparently, according to the Customer Q&A answers, there are generic 2"" replacement foam cushions available that will fit. However, these headphones don't really need replacement cushions since you're probably not listening to audiophile quality music with them anyway and they work fine without any foam cushions at all.Finally, these used to be cheaper, going for about six dollars, but have now gone up in price like with everything else. I'm in the process of rejuvenating the anchor points of several of these headphones at the moment with more glue, and may get some more of these before they go up more in price.","May 23, 2022",AFDWEBB3AFU3X5QNJ73EUKJOGILQ,True,7.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.21786666666666665,Positive,0.9028,Positive

These headphones are lightweight (i.e. easy to carry around while walking), have ""good enough"" sound quality, and were also reasonably cheap to purchase. While I own headphones that have better sound quality, those other headphones are a lot heavier and also were more costly to buy originally. I also own some ""Bluetooth"" (wireless) headphones (whereas these require a headphone jack on your music player), but again those other headphones weigh more and were more costly to purchase.NOTE: These are just headphones, so you do need to supply your own ""music player"" to use with them. I'm personally using my Android smartphone as my portable ""music player"". Yes, the phone is slightly heavier than a standalone MP3 player, but I already carry around my phone when away from the house (so why add a standalone music player I also have to carry?). And with the micro SD card I've put in the phone, I was able to easily store my whole MP3 collection locally on the phone (effectively giving me a HUGE jukebox of music I carry around with me). And, as an added bonus, I also have any other handy phone apps/features whenever I need them. For example, I have a Pedometer app on the phone that automatically records how much I'm walking. And you never know when you might want a digital camera, when you might need GPS mapping software, or have the need to make/receive a phone call (all of which, and more, my phone can handle for me).","May 18, 2023",AFBMX435SBORHDW5RSPM2HTTRYHA,True,11.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.3241379310344827,Positive,0.97,Positive

R272E7B90FDC3M,B075LT8YLR,5.0 out of 5 stars These things ROCK!!!,P. Killion,5,"So I've recently received my Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones, and I've gotta say, I'm impressed! Cheap headphones have come a long way, but these really do take the cake. I've had dozens of headphones in my life, and working in the video production field, I've used some really pricey ones (don't get me wrong, there's a big difference between this type of headphone and high-quality monitor headphones).These are the perfect music/leisure headphones. They have great sound, but the surprising part is how much bass these things put out! It's like having a sub right next to your ear! However, I will point out, these things do put out a little too much bass to be accurate right off the bat, but an EQ can fix that if you prefer a more ""harmonious"" sound; if you like your bass, then you won't have to do a thing. The overall sound output is pretty decent: lows, mids, highs, they're all there. Now, these are cheap so accuracy is a different story (these are slightly muddy compared to more expensive headphones), but like I said, these are leisure headphones, which work excellent for listening to rock/pop/rap, etc. Unless you plan on dishing out $40+, you won't find anything better, and those still might not be great for music listening, since you kinda want that accentuated bass/booming tone for most music (or at least I do).So, these are cheap headphones, don't expect them to last forever, but if taken care of, there's nothing mechanically flawed in the pair. This is the old-school defacto design, and it kinda makes me laugh to see we've moved away from this design for buds (which, at least they have improved, but still don't compare). Since these aren't buds or noise canceling, others will be able to hear your music at higher volumes, but it really isn't that bad, since these have ""ports"" I figured it might be louder externally than it actually is.I believe another reviewer pointed this out already, but the title is misleading, the port is merely referring to a literal ""port"" or hole, so that bass can be amplified in the compact design; there aren't like extra plugs or anything wacky on these headphones, just the normal 3.5mm headphones jack. The packaging doesn't even have any mention of the port, which I'm assuming they removed due to confusion; I only knew what XBS was because they used to have it slapped on their products. Also, the cord is 4.5ft in case you wanted to know, I couldn't find that anywhere on Amazon, had to go to another site to find that out; that length is perfect for me, since they are plugged into the front audio jack on a PC sitting on the floor. My previous iPod buds were 3ft and I had to tilt my head to use them.So, all in all, you should buy these. I'm glad I bought them, may buy half a dozen more to be honest, I really enjoy these little headphones!","January 7, 2011",AHUDVGTYIZN2IYMKNP6OIDSEBMSQ,True,10.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.18312451996927803,Positive,0.9977,Positive

R2OBR7SCDHZUWK,B075LT8YLR,"5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic Headphones, even in the year 2012",Mopen,5,"Who would have thought that my search for the most comfortable pair of headphones would lead me to these? I sure didn't. I have tried, and still own, in ear ""bud"" headphones, behind the neck in-ear headphones, medium cup sized over-ear headphones, and huge over-ear closed style headphones. All have their perks, and unfortunately negatives too. The in-ear type of headphones would actually cause me physical pain only shortly after wearing them. The little ones, buds, with the little suction type end piece hurt the most. And the portable factor was dismissible once I realized I had to fight to untangle them each time I wanted to use them. The around the neck in-ear headphones, but no ""suction cup"", would typically yield better results in regards to the length of time before pain commenced. They still hurt after some time, and because the pressure of the band was suppose keep them on your head they weren't very practical for quickly taking off. This also made having them around your neck uncomfortable. Moving on I then tried headphones with over-ear designs. I ended my search with my Audio-technica monitor headphones (ATH-A700). I love them, for the most part. Audio quality is superb, and the comfort of the band is great, as the wing design fits to your head. They have a closed back design so it helps keep outside noise at a reduced level. These positives unfortunately came with some big negatives though. One, obviously, they are not very portable, and much less practical to use in public. Secondly, due to me spending large amounts of time using headphones for work, school, and hobbies, My neck would start to ache. The sheer weight of the headphones was actually causing pain in my neck around my shoulder area. Keep in mind, I was wearing them for close to 5-8 hours straight, so I'm not knocking the ATH-A700s, I still love them. Now the Panasonic RP-HT21. I was doing my normal shopping on amazon when I decided to throw these headphones into my cart as an add on item. I thought to myself, ""What the heck, why not? Would be nice to have a pair I could throw around, travel with. They have to be super light by the looks of them, which has a bunch of benefits in itself. They look like the headphones I had in the 90s though, so there's a chance they sound like crap. I mean it's been close to two decades, technology of headphones has to have drastically changed. Ah, for the money, its worth a shot."" Got them, opened, popped into my clip+, hit play. Simply put, I love them. These headphones have obviously exceeded my expectations. They are light, audio quality is good, and the form factor is perfect for traveling and using in public. The biggest plus to these headphones is that they are extremely comfortable, and I mean they are almost ""not there"" comfortable. Not to mention, the price is fantastic. I will be buying probably around 2-3 more pairs, so I have backups, and a couple to tinker on. I'm thinking of adding a Rean plug and maybe some braided cord, just for fun not because it's needed.","November 8, 2012",AFAL5SYI4K4MUG7ZPERHV44Y4VVQ,True,187.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.1662103174603175,Positive,0.997,Positive

They were smaller than I thought and sat ON the ears despite being labeled as ""over-ear"", it was excruciating after 10 minutes.I got these this morning and they sound great and envelope the ears gently as they wrap around the head. The phones are almost soothing as they cushion the ears and head lovingly.As for the sound, I tried these at high volumes with the AUX-IN of my guitar amp, computer speakers, and stereo (using a 3.5mm adapter) and the sound is crystal clear and studio quality. There is no low or high-end distortion or loss of clarity and can handle the highs and lows easily.Although it's not what I bought these for, I imagine they are comfortable enough to sleep in.You could fall asleep in these and not wake up in ear agony.","December 23, 2023",AENNV3GBAOWJ6XYJGYRKFJMBAUEA,True,12.0,Size: 4.1x 7.2x 7.6Style: Over Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.2951111111111111,Positive,-0.378,Negative

R17QSURV2HDF5B,B075LT8YLR,"3.0 out of 5 stars Just okay. There are better options, especially for bass lovers. (Both styles/versions discussed...)",mofo83,3,"Note: I have now tried both the on-ear (older review) and over-ear style (new review) of these headphones. Both reviews are below.New review of Over Ear style:I am pretty experienced now with ""budget"" headphones... I've tried pairs of sub-$25 phones from JVC, Koss, Sony, Panasonic, etc., plus some slightly nicer pairs from Sennheiser, Panasonic, etc.These are solid headphones for the price, but nothing outstanding in my opinion.The higher-end sound is nice and pretty clear, that's where these shine. The low end is weak and flat compared to the competition - the JVC Flats and all of Koss' lower end phones (KTXPro1, PortaPros, etc.) have better bass. If you mostly listen to hip-hop-rap, I'd pass on the Panasonics and look into the Koss/JVC. (NOTE: I just got these, I'll update as they warm up/break-in, but I can't imagine the bass is going to improve THAT much. UPDATE: They might have gotten a hair better in this regard, but not that much...)Comfort-wise, these over-ears are just okay. If you have large ears, I think these might give you trouble - they're a smallish circular shape that could pinch - luckily I have small ears so they juuuust fit inside the pads. The headband is unpadded hard plastic - not as comfortable as the KTXPro1 (which has a nice gel-suspension band) nor the Flats (which are just smaller/lighter.) The angle the earcups sit at is also not quite right for me, and there's no swivel at all - vertically or horizontally! The JVC have vertical swivel (front-to-back) while the KTXPro1 have horizontal (up-and-down) swivel, both of which lead to a better fit.The long cord is appreciated, though I would have liked a lower-profile jack, as it won't work with my relatively slim phone case on. (This is very annoying, actually...)Overall, these are fine - maybe great for the money, depending on what you listen to/head size/etc - but for me, there are just better options out there.UPDATE: I've now also tried Sennheiser HD 202, and those are superior in just about every way: sound quality (especially low-end); comfort (the cups swivel in multiple directions); cord quality (thicker); looks; etc.Older review of On-Ear version:These headphones are fine for the money, but I would definitely suggest that you spend just a little more and get the Koss KTXPRO1 headphones instead.The Koss phones are MUCH more comfortable (I can't stress this enough) and they also sound better. Trust me, your ears will be glad you spend the extra bucks.I wear the Koss phones for hours each day at work, and they never hurt. These Panasonics are somewhat uncomfortable after less than an hour. I think it's because the face of the phones isn't parallel with my ears, so the from edge of the earpieces digs into my upper jaw.Of course, your head may be different than mine, but I think most users will find the Koss phones more comfortable.Good luck!","August 31, 2013",AHQEXQSXWVETI3LMPTZDZ4XPPK3A,True,3.0,Size: 36 x 6.7 x 0.5 inchesStyle: On Ear - No Mic,Panasonic Headphones,0.21376815388912165,Positive,0.9972,Positive

So although I rated noise cancellation as 1 star, I wasn't concerned about that or seeking that feature since getting that feature can cost a significant amount. I was just wanting a pair to listen to my streaming shows so my wife wouldn't be annoyed by my audio. And the cord on my previous high-end headphones started to fail. Honestly, the sound quality on these compared to my previous high end Sony headphones isn't that much less. These Panasonic ones sound just fine for the price. Sure, there is less low end, but I'll live. The length adjustment is too loose and will easily slide when you put them on and off your head.

I'm just becoming a true audiophile and these are the gateway drug. I spent 400 on Sony WXM1000h which I thought would be the best possible sound, and I think they are for bluetooth headphones, but they use software and computer chips to place the sound dimensionally. These are half the price and the sound is a freaking miracle. I feel like I am in a space and all of the tones and instruments have their own position. I can direct my attention to them individually. I can hear crazy detail in records I've listened to a million times. Someone laughing in the recording booth and they left it in for some reason, really astonishing detail. I guess this is called the ""stage"" which people say is narrow for this model. I don't really understand that but it's just beautiful. I guess everything is spatial but the space is a smaller than a concert hall. If you are like me and always wanted audio experience but are too into cell phones and so think bluetooth and other technology matter, take the leap and buy this. It is life changing. I got a shitty set of bluetooth headphones as well just in order to make hands free phone calls. ditch the tech and get what you really want!*sound is neutral - this means you get the true presentation of the music, not distorted at all*open ear means people sitting next to you can also hear the music even though it is quiet- maybe not great for an office or shared space*no noise cancelling means you can still hear sounds through the phones. I haven't tried these on an airplane but I bet they wouldn't muffle the noise at all. this is on purpose to achieve neutral / spatial sound.*these are huge and don't fold. I don't think I will travel with them, because I don't want to risk breaking them. this could be a plus I think, since every pair of nice headphones I've ever owned have ended up breaking on the hinge. No hinge means they are sturdier.*these are the most light and comfortable headphones I've ever owned. They aren't sweaty or constrictive at all and you can wear them for hours. the ear cups are super soft. some bad reviews are saying they feel flimsy but they are designed to be light and the open design lets in normal air circulation.*No MIC you can't make phone calls. Hey do yourself a favor and take a break from your phone to enjoy your music!I think of this kind of like a fixed - gear bike. if you get rid of all the gears the chain is shorter and the whole mechanism works more effectively and you get more power for your pedalling. If you strip away all of the options you are used to having with headphones and just focus on the quality of sound you will end up with these headphones. They are the lowest priced product in the audiophile category and the sound is life changing if you've never experienced it before. The sound is light years beyond anything digital or bluetooth can deliver. You probably won't wear them out of the house but so what. Don't be tricked into 500 dollar bluetooth headphones, just get these for music and some cheaper bluetooth headphones for hands free calls and you will end up with the same price tag and way more enjoyment.TLDR: If you are considering 500 dollar bluetooth headphones because you love music, get these and a pair of cheap bluetooth headphones instead.","May 31, 2021",AHQ6KXSIHI343NL2IMQVUADEO7WA,True,145.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.24195906432748537,Positive,0.9965,Positive
R3CPKVLGFHKSKB,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Tried HD599se and X2HR,Ju-Miao Cheng,5,"So this year I really wanted to try open back headphones, it was a new world I found out about. I have bluetooth aukey and anker earbuds, Sony XB900N, HyperX Cloud PS4 (same as pc,xbox versions), and other wired earbuds. A big plus is I can hear my surroundings with open-back. This fall I did research, and learned so much about audio that I didn't care for before, but now fascinated. I'm still not doing the amp thing. SO I hope this review helps someone.My ultimate two choices came down to Sennheiser HD599se and Philips X2HR. These two are so opposite when it comes to available information on the web. Tons of X2HR forums, reviews, videos, etc., and HD599se not so much. I wanted an open back headphone, for primarily games, and secondary music and movies.I almost decided to keep both headphones because it was so hard to choose. Here are the differences first:- X2HR too heavy for me. I thought it wouldn't matter. Very comfy but gets heavy soon after and too noticeable.- X2HR definitely a boomier bass. Think deep rich smooth.- HD599se, super comfy, probably my most comfy headphone. Ears don't get hot or sweaty like my Sony ANC headphones. Can wear for hours which others I kind of need to take breaks.The first headphone I opened was X2HR. First song was a Paul Taylor's Push to Start. I almost cried, I don't think I've experienced a wide sound stage before. Deep bass and open audio experience like no other. It was like listening to song you knew but in a different way. Everything sounded great. Then I listened to more Paul Taylor, then Tobu, Axero, etc. Yeah there's awesome bass.Then I couldn't contain myself I had to try the HD599se. First I was underwhelmed. Not wide, actually felt almost like closed back headphones. But I was surprised to hear bass, I was worried it would be non-existent. There was bass, but not as much as X2HR. Then I tried both on my PS4 controller. Both can were loud enough so no issues here.Two days later I tried them again, but put on the HD599se first and listened. They were actually really good, not as bad as I remembered. Then I put on X2HR. Now I noticed the differences clearer. In Jazz, the sax was so much more clearer and cleaner. Guitars sounds beautiful. So much more balanced, not neutral, but everything is presented well. X2HR, bass does cloud the instruments, as its more pronounced I feel.Ultimately, after listening to more music from tobu, axero, gramatik, jack johnson, nora jones, paul taylor, haywyre, etc., and playing ps4, I really wanted to keep both for different purpose. But in the end I chose one because I knew I'd only use one most of the time. Here's why I chose the Sennheiser HD599se:- Audio is very balanced, and easy to listen to most genres. I like the bass doesn't overwhelm everything. Everything is pretty much at the same level. The instruments sounds much clearer. Its like if the artist wants more bass in the song, you'll definitely notice it. Its seems more a match for what the artist probably wanted you to hear.- I don't know if burn-in happened, or what exactly that is, but over time I feel like the bass and audio quality of HD599se got significantly better. Or maybe its that it sounds better on my PC than phone, and that's when I notice it.- Hip hop, jazz, blues, etc was a pleasure. Only edm sounded better on X2hr to me.- Gaming was much more enjoyable on HD599se. In FPS like call of duty, I could hear my surroundings better and anticipate people around me. In sports games, I felt like crowd noise was overwhelming on X2hr, such as FIFA.- Super comfortable and light.- I spend alot of time already listening to music on the HD599se because its really good. I appreciate these more and more as I listen to music. I'm not analyzing, just listening and doing my thing.In closing, I wish I could keep both. But won't. I wish Sennheiser had a little more bass, but its enough. You will hear the boom, bass hum, the usual, but just not as much or rich as X2HR. I wish HD599se had wider soundstage, which the X2hr had. Really like that openness... alot. If you like lots of bass and don't mind to sacrifice some of the audio of the instruments such as sax, piano, guitar, and ok with heavier headphone, then X2HR is amazing. I went back and forth so much between the two, and was hard to pick. I had to really listen alot. In the end I'm really happy with my decision and awesome black friday price.

They are not going to put out planar quality sound no matter how much you EQ but for dynamic drivers they sound good. Extremely easy to drive with phone or laptop 3.5mm jack. They are very comfortable and build quality is good for $89 headphones. For $89 I just can't complain. If I paid $200 then I would definitely be a lot more critical because for $350 you can get planar's that are on another level than these and most dynamic driver headphones.,"September 2, 2024",AHTWHS3NROWGGK3PVCFUMUSECWMQ,True,1.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.39784313725490206,Positive,0.9846,Positive
R1HHYTDDI023BW,B01L1IICR2,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Headphones,Nash,4,"After doing a lot of research on this model I finally decided to get it. Now to clear this up, these headphones are always on sell nowadays and you can see that on CamelCamelCamel. I think what happened is that since these are a pretty old model compared to their newer ones plus this version special edition out as well the sellers decided the price needed to be lowered. So instead of lowering the main price they just put it on forever sell to increase the buyers into thinking they are saving money. Now I got this for 115 dollars so it isn't the worst price for this headphone.The audio is good, so you don’t have to worry about it being meh for the price. Now there isn’t any 7.1 surround sound and you get the basic sound. The good thing is that basic sound is more finely tuned so if you are doing sound editing or music writing these may be what you are looking for.The design isn’t really anything special on the looks. But they did put in effort in how the joints work in order to reduce the stress of every joint. My last pair only had one joint and after a year of use the stress broke the plastic casing. With this one you have three joints (the last one is the bending of the band on top of the head) that help keep the stress down to keep these in good shape even with long term usage.The cables they include are very handy. You get two kinds, one for the standard 3.5mm jack and another for the 6.3mm jack plus a conventional piece for 6.3mm to 3.5mm. If you want to use these for a podcast and still be able to hear everyone while having the 6.3mm jack for the rest of the podcast hardware, well, here you go. The jack port on the headset itself is the smaller jack of 1.2mm which still works very well while keeping the headphones slim. They are not that bulky or heavy so you don’t have to worry about any neck pain throughout the day.Comfort. I would say these are pretty comfortable so far. Using them for a week and my ears are not being pressed too hard, clipped, hair isn’t being caught in the joints, and haven’t had any sweating issues with the padding. I believe the makers have indeed made a very well headset in the idea of comfort.False Information on Amazon page. The 599 headphones do not require any batteries. I looked up and down on the headphones themselves, read the manual it came with, and looked directly at their site. These do not use batteries. These are not wireless headphones. Not even the SE ones are wireless and requiring batteries. Not sure who created that page but they must have mixed something from another headset.Do I recommend these? Yeah, the price isn’t bad for 115 dollars and these do have a place to be used. If you want to use these while in a very loud environment then I do not recommend these as it will not block any noise whatsoever.","October 7, 2023",AFUBBREM2TFXCKQXR43IA7QLX77A,True,26.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.1445905483405483,Positive,0.9384,Positive
R2NG7JPCFYIT80,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Caution: Entering Audiophile Territory,Allen D. Reinecke,5,"I have a pair of Sennheiser HD438's, but I hadn't used them much in the recent years. I was more into TWS earbuds and then transitioned to wired IEM's. I recently dug out my old Sennie's for a change and really appreciated the forgotten comfort and sound signature. So, I decided to research today's headphones. The HD 599 SE was in the right price bracket (I've spent way too much already, according to my wife!!) and the reviews gave it high marks for soundstage, comfort, sound signature and open-back bass. I knew Sennheiser was durable. My HD438's are still in excellent condition after 11 or 12 years. The SE traditional coloring is much better suited to my taste than the HD 599..DESIGN & BUILD:The Industrial Stylist at Sennheiser must have a really tedious job. I was surprised how similar my 11-year-old HD 438 is to the HD599. No major styling change there in all that time! At least that shiny spoke pattern, which reminds me of my truck wheels, is gone! The headphones are equally comfortable, with a touch more pressure on the HD599. My glasses are not forced onto my head though and I can wear these for hours. The oval earcups are quite large vertically, like the HD 438, and fit my big ears perfectly to be truly ‘over-the-ear’ ‘phones. I have room to spare, but not much!.While these headphones are made of plastic, they are very strong and you’ll struggle to break them. You can twist and spread these around and not crack anything..I’m not a fan of the dedicated 2.5mm (?) twist-lock connector into the headphone, but at least there are aftermarket replacements available. I have no idea why the adapter on the longer cable is a large female to small male and the large male 6.35mm connector is on the cable. The cable should be 3.5mm and the adapter should enlarge the connector. With the adapter on, the cable end is just too honking big!.My only criticism would be the headband adjustment. I liked the SHP 9500 with its strong detent and numbering system. I find the headband can go out of adjustment too easily handling the headphones and I have to judge the gap in the headband visually for my best fit..SOUNDSTAGE & IMAGING:When I got the HD 599 SE, I plugged them straight into my phone and was totally blown away. The frequency curve is essentially neutral with a hint of coloration. The bass rolls off below 40Hz but the treble stays strong right up to the 20kHz limit. The mids are slightly cool but are certainly not ‘recessed’.I felt like…- I was in a room with the musicians. The reproduction was totally natural.- The bass was really solid, surprisingly so for an open-back headphone. Maybe not bass head worthy, but punchy, crisp, and realistic.- The treble was clear, detailed and ‘Sennheiser smooth’. I really liked my Momentum TW2 earbud sound signature, but as buds go, they are dated (app and ANC) compared with other brands and I ended up returning them. ☹‘Hold me now’ by the Thompson twins, ‘Honey and the Bee’ by Owl City, and ‘Appetite’ by Prefab Sprout can be quite harsh, even sibilant, at the upper end on all my IEM's and some of my TWS buds. I like a bright sound, but not sibilant and grainy. The HD 599 SE was so natural sounding and just… gorgeous.- The soundstage is what I've been seeking and missing with closed back and in-ears. Hotel California - Live on MTV 1994 by the Eagles sounds amazing. That punch at 32s is awesome. ‘Strive’ by Amber Rubarth, ‘Killing me softly…’ by Roberta Flack, 'Unearthed - Orchestral version' by Wildpath, and ‘Your Grace is enough – Live’ by Matt Maher are just sublime. There’s both width and height with correctly mixed tracks. Try listening to “Best 8D song EVER with headphones 2021 – HD” on YT. Awesome!- Imaging is also superb and it’s easy to pick out the location of instruments. ‘Buck Dance’ by Dick Schory’s New Percussion Ensemble has your senses tracking all over the stage!.I’d not used open back headphones before trying the SHP 9500 and I actually liked the feel and openness, compared with closed-back. However, the SHP 9500 did not have the sound staging I was after. The HD 599 SE certainly does.Of course, you need to use these in a quiet room to save your ears. With the 106dB sensitivity and 50 Ohm impedance, I do have to use 70 to 80% volume directly connected to my phone, compared with 40% on my IEM’s. Still plenty loud enough for me, but you may not agree. Please take care of your hearing though!.I have a collection of Earbud Test Tracks, which I use to assess my earphones….https://music.amazon.com/user-playlists/6c1a03929ed947ab82cc33db24d7c001sune?ref=dm_sh_c7f9-3dba-7009-a4cd-8323a.I usually use a Qudelix 5K DAC/AMP. I loaded Oratory1990’s HD 599 PEQ and with the HD 599 connected, I noticed that it cleaned up the lower/mid bass just a tad. On some tracks, the bass can get a little muddy. I felt that a little more treble was needed and slightly less bass though to suit my taste. So, I adjusted the PEQ and I now have my final settings (see photo)..CONCLUSION:For a consumer-friendly price, you are truly entering Audiophile territory with the HD 599. I have no reticence in stating that.When the HD 599 go on sale, they are an absolute must-have. I bought these for the current price of $150. I still think that’s a steal!The HD 599 SE are now my go-to for serious listening late at night and I think they could be yours also!","April 23, 2022",AFIQPBHZIPZ2FBWIOSJYGOPAH2LA,True,221.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.18911797801108557,Positive,0.9992,Positive
R3K19HF6CXRHH1,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones for under $500.,Allen K.,5,"For years now, I've been using wireless earbuds. These have ranged from $30 Tozos to $$300 Sonys, but though they were great for late-night movie watching, none really satisfied me. I wanted something for music that sounded like a high end stereo system. These Sennheiser are it! I paired them with an Ifi Zen Dac II dac and headphone amp connected to the high res digital music library on my laptop. I especially like the open back design of the headphones. It enables me to remain cognizant of my surroundings so I know if one of my animals needs something, but it also makes the music sound much more natural. (I had previously tried the Sennheiser 560 closed-back, but I felt like I was isolated in a cocoon. Just personal preference.) With the open-back design of the 599's, you often can't tell if the music is coming from the headphones or from another source in the room. That surprised me! It sounds like a $3000+ stereo system is filling the room with music, rather than the music coming from the headphones. The headphones are also incredibly comfortable & fatigue-free. At around $200, these are mid-range for Sennheiser and worth far more, as the build quality is as superb as the sound quality. BTW, I do recommend getting a balanced cable; these headphones are good enough that you'll notice the difference if you have a balanced source such as my Zen Dac II. You won't find another set of headphones this good for anywhere near this price for high-quality home listening. I'd give them 10 stars if possible! Just make sure you have a source producing high quality sound for the phones to reproduce, for while they'll make anything sound better, you won't fully appreciate them if you're using them to watch Beverly Hillbillies reruns on TV.","May 14, 2024",AH5NEHXKKNFP3I43BL6W5K2CMKRA,True,8.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.2831720430107527,Positive,0.9938,Positive
R1D949UYSPS6C5,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth it when on sale,Brandon Kleeman,5,"I’m still relatively new to collecting headphones, but I do have a small collection for reference. I have used the Samson SR850s, SR860s with after market earpads, Moondrop Chu’s, Moondrop Chu II’s, Tanchjim Zeros, and both iterations of the AirPod Pros. These in short the HD599s are good enough that I can easily tell the difference in quality from listening to an MP3 on a iPod verses the same MP3 on my phone. So if you want these for listening to your old iPod you are overspending. I can also tell the difference in quality in certain FLAC files verses their MP3 counterparts, though I will admit the difference is slight to my untrained ears. I bough these on sale for ~$120 which I feel is more than a fair price for the product I received. Now for the compare and contrasting…In terms of audio quality the HD599s and the Chu II are my favorite sounding headphones. (If you want less bass and a more sparkly sound get the original Chus or the Zeros. Lofi, classical instruments, and female vocals in particular sounds amazing with them) They are both fairly balanced with a warmer bass. They both have a very different quality of sound thanks to these being an open back headphone and the Chu II’s having more of a passive noise cancelation. I can’t put it into words. Some say open backs sound fuller thanks to their open nature, but that word doesn't hit the spot for me. Needless to say, I find myself switching between both frequently to scratch the itch each of the qualities provide depending on my mood. The HD599s are naturally a harder to run so I have to crank the volume on my phone more, but they are still perfectly drivable without a dedicated DAC/AMP. The Chu II’s start at $20, but if you are cursed with small waxy ear canals, like myself, then you will have to replace the filters fairly frequently (every ~5 days) which would cost me around $4 a month with my average use case. That is a bit of a hassle and a hidden cost that is rarely mentioned. The HD599’s always sound good since they are not subject to the same moist conditions. Can you get competing sound for cheaper if you go the IEM (in ear monitor) route? Yes, but sometimes you just want over the ear headphones for the sake of comfort, lack of hassle, and sharability.If your not interested in IEMs like the Chu II’s then here is a comparison to the SR850s (the SR860s are basically identical, but have another color way and are usually more expensive). In terms of comfort the HD599’s are far more comfortable out of the box. The pads of the SR850’s touch my ears which felt fine until I experienced better, now I don't care for them and wouldn’t wear them for long periods of time. The HD599’s actually sit around my ears with the inner pads being deep enough that they don’t touch my ears. The ear cups also swivel to conform to my head which also improves the experience. Where things get interesting is if you splurge for after market velour pads for the SR850s which cost an additional ~$20 (I got mine from TRANSTEK). These increase the total cost to around $60 but feel equally comfortable (if not slightly more so) than the HD599s. I haven't seen any aftermarket pads that look as thick and soft for the HD599s yet, but if I do, I will definitely give them a try and update this review.The sound quality is a matter of preference between the two, I like the warmer and slightly fuller sound of the HD599s and I think the top end sounds slightly more crisp/accurate.In terms of sound leakage the HD599s are definitely worse. You don't want to use these if you don't want people to listen in to your content. With the SR850s you can tend to avoid people listening in if you’re at a moderate volume. If you are in a noisy house with children then both of these may not be right for you. You would want to look into closed back or IEMs. I personally like open backs because you can still hear the world around you when you’re working. You are not in your personal bubble.The removable cable is the greatest quality of life feature of the HD599s. It comes with two cables out of the box: a long boi with a chonky 6.3mm jack with a step down adapter to 3.5, and a reasonably sized 3.5mm cable. The SR850s in contrast have a non removable long 3.5mm cable with a step-up 6.3mm adapter. As a result the SR850’s don’t leave my desk and the cables stay cable managed underneath it. The HD599s offer way more flexibility. I use my short cable for around the house listening on my phone, handheld game consoles, and occasionally on my AMP/DAC on my PC while reserving the long cable for watching TV on my sofa or bed.If you’re looking for solid stationary desk headphones for work and general use with a flat sound get the SR850s with the aftermarket earpads are fantastic for the money and will beat pretty much any “gaming” headphone on the market in terms of sound quality. They also dont have much audio leakage so they may work well in an office setting as you can still hear what is going on around you. If you want convenience buds for daily use that you keep on you 24/7 get the AirPod Pros (the first gen had better connectivity and range but the second gen sound slightly better). If you want great affordable sound (with some maintenance) go the IEM route and snag the Chu’s or Zeros for a flat accurate sound or the Chu II’s for a warmer sound that maintains the accuracy on the top end. If you want excellent open backs that can be driven without an external DAC/AMP that are slightly warm then the HD599s are great.I don't think I would buy the HD599s at the retail cost of $250 considering the HD600s (the de facto benchmark for over 20 years) often drop down to $300 on sale or $250 in used like-new condition, but at $120 I think they are a fair price for what they offer as a package. They are versatile, comfortable, and accurate enough that you can hear the differences between good and bad mp3 playback and (depending on the file or the quality/accuracy of your hearing) the difference between a FLAC and MP3.Welcome to audiophile country, open your wallets and enjoy the process of nitpicking sound quality to justify your purchases. I hope you enjoy your descent.","September 22, 2023",AH5VY6P5674XUUKKYWEMZGSBW4QQ,True,47.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.19548538823347972,Positive,0.9995,Positive

I sold them to my little bro because he was into music production. After years of low quality gaming headsets I decided that I missed high quality spatial sound. After a lot of research I decided to get these. They are easily comparable to my old setup at less than half the cost with no amplifier needed and 100x more comfortable. They come with multiple cords and adapters for all needs (3.5 or 6.5) and they sound good on any device. The pads are soft and the fit is snug but not tight for maximum comfort despite prolonged usage. The spatial sound performance is exactly what I was looking for! Music and FPS gameplay is so much more enjoyable. If you’re on the fence about these headphones I encourage you to pull the trigger. They are well worth the price.

The sound is nothing like what i've had before, being a guy used to budget gaming headsets, and both with music and in game the sound quality is phenomenal.One negative thing I will mention, in the images it shows an adapter so you can use the long cable with a small port, but that was not included in the box, so I have to use the smaller cable, which is no problem for me because I have an extension cable, but might be problematic for others.Also, this feels kind of obvious, but if you are in a noisy environment, I'd recommend against trying out open back headphones, as background noise can be quite distracting.

I wish that would become a standard.Here’s my only complaint: the cable is extremely stiff, maintaining kinks and loops, catching on corners and rubbing on my clothes. I was considering to replace it until I realized that you can’t. The connector on the headset side is a proprietary 2.5mm TRRS with a bayonet locking mechanism. So while the cable is replaceable (as are the ear pads), you can only replace it with the same cable from Sennheiser.I’ll probably get over that, but it’s a miss that should be addressed in future models.","July 24, 2024",AFJ374VCWHJ2CH4LYYPAA6XAHLCQ,True,1.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.17827731092436974,Positive,0.9223,Positive

It almost defies understanding that a company as fantastic as Senheisser would release a headband design like this. I will say again, that the sound and ear cup comfort of the 599 is fantastic. But they create a hot spot on top of the head where the head band with modest foam point loads the top of the head. No reason for it. Seinnheiser even understands this dynamic and sell both less expensive like the HD-559 and the more upscale HD 650 headphones with a much more padded and headband with a void at the top of the head which could cause irritation.If you guys and girls want to take the dive, look into the Seinheisser HD-6xx which is a knock off of the venerable HD-650 which is twice the price of the 599. These headphones are magic. Go out on youtube and watch some reviews. Best $200 headphone on the market. Just scored an open box purchase in new condition and these are even better in both sound and comfort to the 599. I had NO complaints about the sound quality of the 599 but I need complete comfort. Hope this helps and happy listening.I don't write a lot of reviews but I come from the world of tech and appreciate all genres of music. I recommend everybody interested in the HD 599 to go to youtube and watch some reviews which will be in more depth than mine.I am returning to earphone listening after many years. I built a new AMD CPU based computer which btw I love without a dedicated GPU but with Asrock on board sound which drives these headphones beautifully. Because of their low impedance, not essential to drive them through a dedicated amp.Comfort:Comfort for me for overall listening is ESSENTIAL. It is largely why I bought these. I have largish ears and where a large hat...not a small guy but not a huge guy either. I struggle with the comfort of many headphones. Not these. They are the best. Sennheiser gets it. Other companies not so much.Ear pocket are very large to completely cover my largish ears and my ears though not tea cups stick out a bit...not excessive but require deep and large ear cup openings. These deliver.What isn't understood about earphone design many times is...its a balance of clamping force to the head that determines headband pressure. Higher the clamping force, the less the head band pressure because lateral force negates vertical fall of the headphones. Many headphones with drivers and fidelity this size are heavy. These weigh 250 grams and are light. Therefore they don't require big clamping...rated only at .71 lbs mean clamping...no doubt head width specific.. In summary, because of low weight they don't dig in up top of the head even with low clamping pressure. Genius design and I am a design guy so I appreciate it.Sound:Wonderful. I am not formally a senior...a very active senior and listen to classic rock to some even hip hop...very little, to opera and classical music. I like it all from Mo town to some jazz to mostly classic rock which I grew up...the best music of all time. :-) These headphones deliver. Listen to the reviews. They aren't flat...slightly embellished. An audiophile headphone with a bit of lowest and highs added. What the absolutely non purist wants in a headphone. Very very slight embellishment...almost not. I don't like too much bass but love to hear it. My aging ears don't hear the highs like they once did. I can hear the highs with these. If I EQ them, I can tune them precisely how I like them.They sound magnificient. Btw, they are open headphones and not meant to keep all the sound within. That is design intent and what better listening headphones are. On an airplane, pick a pair of Senn closed headphones.Looks:Looks matter. I am a design guy. Shape, texture and appearance affects perception of the product. 5 out of 5. Perfect. I couldn't design them better. Arguably a 'hint' of retro. Not as retro at the 598. If only the 598 existed, I would get those but these are aesthetically more modern and better IMO. The color is a bit unique. You maybe tired of everything black like me. These are a bit different and absolutely beautiful.I have owned other high end headphones from other companies. These are my favorite. I only have had them for a couple of days. Even in the time I have owned them they have burned in and will burn in much more in the next 200 hrs of listening.My advice. If you like, try everything but own these.Happy listening everybody.

Then I saw that Sennheiser was selling refurbished HD660S models for $199, so I impulsively ordered it. After a couple of weeks of comparing, the HD660S won out and the HD599 went back.

RG5Q7KYLJF10Y,B01L1IICR2,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Option For Portable Devices and Amplifiers, Issues with Computers....",J. Hill,4,"I recently needed to replace my pair of over the ear headphones so I began my search for a good pair of headphones in the $150-$200 range. Immediately Senhiser, Beyerdynamic, and Audio‑Technica stood out. I first received a pair of the Audio‑Technica ATH M-50x which had good sound but were very uncomfortable if worn for more than an hour or so. Then I picked up a pair of the Beyerdynamic DT 770. These headphones had amazing sound quality and comfort but the passive sound isolation was mediocre at best. Which is why I ordered a pair of the Beyerdynamic Premium 990 which are open back. I figured that the sound quality and comfort would be similar but the open back quality would allow me to talk with others while I played music. Unfortunately the 990's had worse sound quality than the 770 (a bit harsher sounding and not as clear) and were very uncomfortable even after only a couple of hours. During this time I also ordered a pair of Senhiser HD 599 headphones. While these headphones have a significantly different sound signature than the others I have tried, they were of similar quality. Overall the HD 599's were slightly less comfortable than the 770's but the open back quality was convenient and the sound was quite nice. I would have been satisfied with the HD 599's but they were the only pair of headphones I could not drive with my desktop. They produced terrible static. This did not occur when I used the 599's on other devices or when I used other headphones (even those with similar impedance and SPL) driven by my desktop computer. This prevented me from keeping them. I have attached a breakdown of my thoughts below:------------Sound Quality------------Beyerdynamic DT 770 (80 Ohm) - WinnerHighs - Quite good representation, much cleaner than SenhiserMids - Quite good representationLows - A little closed sounding but overall they are handled wellOverall this is how the music should sound. They perform the most similar to my pair of Martin Logan Motion 15's (bookshelf speakers)Beyerdynamic Premium 990 (32 Ohm)Highs - Similar to the 770's but rather harsh soundingMids - Nothing special, no major issuesLows - Not as powerful as the 770's but more spacious. Seemed a bit washed out due to the open back designSenhiser HD 599 (50 Ohm) - Close 2nd BestHighs - Not quite as poppy as they should be. They are a bit muted in the sound signature which can make them less fatiguing than other, more analytical, headphones.Mids - A bit to high level for me, it tended to make punk rock music sound very close and muddiedLows - A bit boomy but very spaciousAudio Technica ATH M-50xHighs - Quite good representation, a bit cold thoughMids - Nothing special, no major issues thoughLows - Too over-emphasized-----------------Comfort---------------Beyerdynamic DT 770 - WinnerPerfect. I wore these on multiple occasions for more than 7 hours and never noticed any pressure points or discomfort. The headband is larger than average to distribute the pressure. The clamp pressure is also a bit more than average but this was not an issue due to the soft, replaceable, ear pads.Beyerdynamic Premium 990I could not wear these for more than a few hours. The headband is made of a much harder material than the 770's and causes a painful pressure point on the top of my head. I believe this is made worse by the lower clamping force since more of the weight is on the top of your head.Senhiser HD 599I could wear these for several hours as long as I moved them around every 30-40 minutes. More comfortable than the 990's. Significantly less clamping force than the 770's.Audio Technica ATH M-50xThese were the least comfortable. I could only stand to wear them for an hour or so before I had to take them off. All of the discomfort came from the top of my head.----------------Usability---------------Beyerdynamic DT 770These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average.Beyerdynamic DT 990These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. But I could not hear others quite as well as I could with the HD 599's.Senhiser HD 599The interchange-able cables with different lengths worked perfect for home listening as well as on the go. The cable is also thinner and more flexible than the Beyerdynamic cable. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. The only downfall is the issue I had with compatibility between some devices and this pair of headphones where I would hear static or computer noise when driving them with a computer.Audio Technica ATH M-50xI really love the long coiled cable that came with these. To me this is the best option since I dont have to lug around a long cable or risk losing extra cables. With that being said, it also came with a ~ 9ft straight cable and 3ft straight cable if the coiled cable is too much for you.","September 26, 2018",AEWM47TTRIHOOWK6EIBPURDXVMLQ,True,91.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.14579231692677064,Positive,0.9908,Positive

Eventually leading me to these on a deal.The biggest difference from what I have noticed tend to be smaller ones. The 599se are open back while the 569s were closed back. They look very identical but the design for the ear pads are different. I'd say the quality is slightly better on these.In terms of sound, I absolutely love open back. In my opinion you get more clarity in the sounds. But you do pick up more of the sounds around you, so if that's an issue for you I'd recommend closed back.Overall you still get the amazing Sennheiser sound quality but with the benefits of open back.

Some headphones I've used in the past have a pretty noticeable squeeze; but not these. There is minimal pressure on the side of my head, but also just enough force to prevent them from slipping when I move my head around. I overheat easily and was a little nervous about the plush looking earcups being too warm, but these have been very breathable and I don't sweat in them at all.I can't say I have a trained audiophile ear, but I am an avid music listener and have 0 complaints about the sound quality. The sound feels wide and open with good clarity on everything from the main melody to the smallest of embellishments in the mix. These felt like a considerable upgrade over my previous headphones in the sound department.Lastly, I didn't buy these for the swappable cord/input but it has turned out to be a pretty handy feature.

Right now I am trying to find a deep bass that makes your whole body feel it, but it's extremely hard to find.I came across the Senn HD599 and for the price I had to try them. I have never had an open cup headphone, which was a delightful change of pace as well.I can say the sound of these are really phenomenal, all around honestly. I still don't have the bass I am chasing, but this set of heaphones really surprised me with how well it takes those lower frequencies. I can switch from techno > hip hop> dance > jazz > blues and it all sounds sublime. Truly a well rounded pair of headphones.The cups have velour wrapping and I find the headphones super comfortable to wear for several hours at a time. I am waiting on a headphone amp to use these babies to listen to my vinyl straight from the player.My one frustration was the book for this product is just a safety/hazard piece of paper. Nothing to tell you anything about the heaphones, no stats, or why they had 2 cables and not just the 1 with the adapter. In the box the longer cable was already attached, and I did not know it should be detachable. I had not seen/didn't remember reading that on the amazon page, so I was a bit confused at the extra cable at first thinking it wasn't detachable.Then on top of that, finally realizing its supposed to be detachable cables, there is nothing to tell you that the cable locks in the headphones. I couldn't get it to detach and thought it was defective; I had to search through reviews and Q&A to finally read that they lock and you have to twist and then pull. That seems like information they REALLY need to put with the product so it isn't broken in ignorance. I haven't bought a really nice, sorta pricey, pair of heaphones like this in over 20 years. Back then they did not lock lol.

R3PBC2UE3G1N46,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars First pair of headphones fancier than earbuds,D. Smith,5,"These are pretty darn wonderful, but you should know, this is my first upgrade from earbud style headphones and that is my only point of comparison. But if you are tiptoeing into the more expensive world of fancier headphones to get your audio thrills like me, I can say that I am super happy with this investment.My setup: I paired these headphones with DragonFly Cobalt DAC, Amazon Music Hi Def streaming, iPhone to USB camera adapter. The first night I had these, I couldn't stop listening to music, because it was like I was hearing my favorite albums for the first time again. Constant goosebumps and visceral sensations from just being able to hear more in the music and with a stronger sense of space and left/right channel movement. The improvement in my listening experience is pretty astounding. I am not exaggerating to say at one point, listening to Jacob Collier, I heard some glorious new pretty that made me think I was feeling a tear welling up in my eye!I ordered this pair specifically because the price was greatly reduced on a pair of headphones listed as ""used, like new"", which arrived with a ""refurbished"" sticker on the box. The excellent deal pretty much was the decision maker on my model choice and alleviated some of the financial pain of also needing to invest in a headphone DAC/Amp + iPhone adapter to make this step up in my listening experience. I agree that the ""like new"" assessment was accurate. I see no signs of wear or any signs that these are not just new headphones. My only complaint is that they smell like they've been sprayed with some kind of household deodorizer (I won't mention brand names, but you find it in the cleaning aisle, not in the perfume aisle - so it's not someone's personal fragrance left behind on the soft materials). It's pretty much the exact same smell that all of amazon's blue and white bubble plastic shipping bags smell like. I don't know where the fragrance fairies are in this process -at sennheiser refurbishing?, at the shipping warehouses? in my local delivery trucks? but I spent my first hour listening with utmost joy to my music while also fighting off an asthma attack from the fragrance. That's how good these sound, I was willing to endure asthma to keep listening, but really, can the fragrance fairies stop this business? You might literally kill someone. For what I saved on these headphones though, I'm willing to air them out for a few weeks. And other than the asthma, they are otherwise very comfortable to wear , even after a day of wearing a mask that rubs the back of my ears raw. I've felt teddy bears less soft than these ear cushions. They're pretty sweet.If you are like me and new to this process, I do want to confirm that open back headphones are truly audible to those around you, even at ""save your hearing"" volumes. So these are definitely ""at home"" headphones. Since I was aiming to give myself a tool for inducing happy-brain sensations and deep relaxation after a stressful workday, these suit my needs perfectly. My intention was to use these someplace quiet and private. If you need something for travel, or to drown out outside noises, these aren't going to be well matched to that need. If you want a music goosebumps and can match these with a Hi-Def music source and headphone amp/DAC, then these should make you very happy.","November 3, 2022",AFV54L5S6G47ZAXGYH226YK4DCOQ,True,24.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.22298111202522963,Positive,0.999,Positive

You can pick up on all those little details you didn't even know were there before.And let's talk comfort. These headphones are like wearing fluffy clouds on your ears. The cushions are super soft, and the headband is padded just right. I can wear these bad boys for hours without feeling like my head's in a vice.They look pretty slick too. The ivory color adds a nice touch of style, so you'll look as good as your music sounds.Whether you're chilling at home or on the go, the Sennheiser HD 599 headphones are a must-have for anyone who loves music. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!","June 11, 2024",AHU6EF4TA6VTSF2LJL5MHWV2IRPA,True,1.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.07485119047619049,Positive,0.9908,Positive

R21UQ6HQVMOH55,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Very good at this price point,Frank_A,5,"Reading how the 599s were supposed to have a fuller bass and not as accurate as the 600s (for that reason), I was surprise to experience this as not true to my perceptions. In fact, I added 3dB at 120hz just to bring some perceptible warmth to the sound. After listing for a while now, I consider them very articulate and detailed, with no harsh mid-range, and suitable for a variety of music genre. Currently less than half the price of the 600s, I believe they are a great value. If the 600s are ""cleaner"" with less bass then I'd rather have the 599s. I listen to a lot of acoustic music and vocals. So if the sound is off, harsh, or not detailed then I cannot enjoy them. The soundstage seems great, not ""forward"" to bother you after a while but maybe that's part of being an open-back model. Not sure. Highly recommended.","June 17, 2024",AG5BPXAPNCYSER73YY3SHXCWUUKQ,True,1.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.14925000000000002,Positive,-0.1946,Negative

R2IKI3SGZ2J8XD,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Sooo amazing!,MarinaAnselmo,5,"Listening to music through headphones has been a regular part of my daily routine since I was a teenager. I have a nice vinyl collection and a Sony receiver. In 2007 I purchased a set of Sennheiser HD 202 Dynamic Headphones that lasted forever. Then they were lost on a trip. I started using wireless headphones while making music in the DAW and that was fine but realized I had gotten away from just relaxing with headphones and a coiled cable since the old 202s were lost. Yesterday I decided I needed to get a new pair.I ordered these and they arrived Same-day. Nice. The moment I plugged them in and put on my favorite record (All Them Witches - dying surfer meets his maker) I thought I was going to cry. The bass was perfect, the mids and highs, perfection. The oval shape of the over-the-ear design is genius. I LOVE the cushion. Soft and conformtable. I ended up spending 3 hours straight listening to music yesterday and went to bed feeling super calm and relaxed. Wow. These headphones are beautiful, quality and could stand up next to a pair quadruple the price. I could not be happier.","May 27, 2024",AFPWB5HRSSGA5UJV5KQQZYXTABPA,True,5.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.2940191387559808,Positive,0.9945,Positive

After putting them on I immediately felt how uncomfortable they are from the pressure on the sides of my head! After about 15 minutes I was fatigued and sore from having them on! I have other brands and do not have any issues with comfort. The HD 599SE sound is good but way too much on the bass end! Being a musician and recording music you really need a flat over all response. Lastly this set is not using a screw on 3.5mm adapter? Is had a plug in adapter and it protrudes a out 3 inches out when used. I was really considering the HD-600 but can not justify spending that much so looking for a more mid range price for reasonable quality for my applications.

R3NWDBD27LXRB,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars All Day Comfort and Great Sound,Horsethief,5,"I have a hard time finding hats that fit. If this sounds like you than you may be in luck. These headphones fit my head just fine with a little space to spare which is perfect for getting them positioned just right.I needed a headset for streaming purposes that was comfortable enough to wear all day. I also wanted something open backed so I could speak easily and ideally something that sounded good. I wanted all of this at the bare minimum budget price because I've decided I'm done spending a bunch of money on nice headphones.These have checked all of the boxes except the bare minimum budget box but it was worth paying a little more for these. I won't go too far into sound since others have already described it well but here are my one week pre burn in thoughts:1) These headphones are tuned to feel engaging out of the box. They are not as clinical as a set of AKGs. This is an excellent set to turn on your favorite album, close your eyes, and get lost in the music.2) As a lifelong basshead these headphones may not satisfy sub-bass enthusiasts. They're open backed so they're not meant for that. However the bass they do reproduce is clean and fills nicely out of the box. It's just not gonna bump hard enough to get your booty shakin. To do that you'll need an amp with bass boost or to play with an EQ.The headphones take well to mild equalization on the low end. If I EQ the sub-bass a bit too high they'll crackle. But if I EQ to just where the sub-bass starts to overpower the track somewhat and then step it down to where it blends these definitely got my booty shakin.If you absolutely must crank your bass then you really need go with closed back sets or IEMs. Some IEMs don't seem to care how much you EQ bass. They'll reproduce it happily without a crackle.Most importantly let's talk about comfort. These headphones are a dream to wear. After I put them on I forget I'm even wearing them throughout the course of a 6 hour stream. After I'm done I usually just keep them on and continue listening to music or working on things. I got done with a stream an hour ago and I'm still wearing them right now.The earpads are truly over ear and I have a big set of ears. No part of my ear touches the earpad or the driver so there's no pressure point other than the cloth pads resting on my head. Clamp force is perfect and doesn't cause any pain either. This is particularly nice since I wear glasses.If you have a big dome and need a set of all day work headphones buy these and you won't be disappointed! You may find you want to keep wearing them and listen to music after you're done working...","January 3, 2023",AF2P45UBQD7ENWD4FFHVGOW5JL7A,True,26.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.1975344414495358,Positive,0.9952,Positive

R2SEN0ON142L4U,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Better than my B*se,Hinkydoo,5,"These are by far the best headphones I’ve ever used. I’ve been using a pair of B*se quiet comforts, which I originally bought for airplane trips. Those work well for noise cancellation but they have no range or depth compared to these.The Sennheiser’s go on sale from time to time, and if you can get them under $90 then they’re a no-brainer. Someone who wants the best possible sound for the lowest cost of acquisition and who is going to be using these at home in a quiet / private environment will be very happy with this purchase.I would not recommend these for airlines or other forms of public transportation, as the open back model allows others to hear what you are listening to, at the same volume. These are not appropriate for public places. Likewise, you will hear everything around you, and not in a good way. The wire makes these inappropriate for any sort of exercise as well. You would be better served with a bone speaker which is wireless and which allows for the ambient noise around you to still be audible.These are very appropriate for someone who is listening/mixing/producing music at home, or for someone who is playing video games or watching movies in a private room. The surround sound is spot on and clear, the range is vast, and the sounds are crisp. Moreover the ear muffs themselves are very very comfortable. The microfiber lining allows for hours of wear. The holes for your ears are very large, so if you have big ears then these are good. Note, these are good for ears which sit close to the head, if you happen to have ears like dumbo the elephant which are seated far from your head then these may not be for you, as I can feel them rubbing one of my ears not from the top, bottom or sides but from the outside and it is uncomfortable from time to time. These also fit people with large heads, I have a large head and a lot of hair and these fit very nicely for long stretches of time (IE several hours without removing them).The last thing to note is that the volume on these at “10” is equal to my Bluetooth headphone when the volume is set to “60”, so you’ll get a much louder headphone. If you have very very sensitive hearing then that could be an issue, but if you are not super sensitive these will be better than Bluetooth in that regard.At $200 they’re alright, but under $90 they’re really something. I would rate these as a buy, but unless you have money to burn then wait for them to go on sale and you’ll be very happy indeed.","April 11, 2023",AEWR6E75J32KJTQ4NC6OWKEIALFA,True,27.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.24549953314659193,Positive,0.9883,Positive

I thought that they would be an upgrade from these. I just started a return of the HD 650s because these HD 599s, I found, had a better sound stage, neutral sound signature, and are lighter and more comfortable in terms of head clamping compared to the HD 650s. Yes, those HD 650s are more than double the price! For many, it would be an upgrade. For me, the sound of the HD 650s is warmer, the sound stage is less pronounced, and they are built sturdier than the HD 599s. However, those factors that some would consider it as a valuable upgrade, are what contribute to my preference for my old set of HD 599s. It really depends on what you are looking for. I don't like any coloration in my sound, and because I use it for gaming, the sound stage is something I am after. When I listen to music, it is more for classical, rock, and basically instrumental genres. I am not an audiophile, so I can only give you why I like these compared to another set that I purchased that was more than double its price, and I ended up returning.","April 2, 2024",AEOAKEQBTGPRNDDABJYL7DKGZZTQ,True,1.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.29666666666666675,Positive,0.8901,Positive

R35WXPB7NBR99,B01L1IICR2,4.0 out of 5 stars Great for Voices,ERT,4,"Got these and immediately loved the feel on the head.The Good!- The ear pads are firm but velvety and soft on the head, the size is more than enough to fit my whole ear, and the build quality is pretty damn good.- Did a sound test - the bass does not and will not rumble your ears but every instrument is crystal clear and you can hear almost every frequency.- For voices? PODCasts? Overkill. Beautifully clear and realistic sound.- Music? Not bad! Never loses quality no matter the volume from the softest soft to the loudest loud.The bad?- Uses a 2.5mm to a 3.5mm aux cord. They give you a studio cord with a guitar amp end and an adapter and also just a regular 2.5 to 3.5. The 2.5 to 3.5 has already broken! I've owned it for 2 days. Love the little twist lock of the 2.5 so it doesn't get yanked out at the slightest movement, but overall a disappointing and unreliable cord.- On top of that, the left to right panning is subpar. Did a surround sound test.... it worked but the left side with the aux cord responds differently. Definitely don't use for surround sound if you dont want to upgrade and buy a much nicer aux cord that can handle it.- Final bad thing is that people can and will hear your music/sounds if you have any volume above... say 25%. It does NOT contain the sounds to your headphones.If these headphones last 2 or more years, well worth the buy.

R25UTNXNS7GFW9,B01L1IICR2,"4.0 out of 5 stars Nice headphones, very comfortable, but...",Albert Flasher,4,"The Sehhheiser HD 599s are very nice looking headphones and are the most comfortable of five sets I have tried. That said I want headphones to sound good as well and the HD 599s just weren't cutting it This is where the HD 599s fall a bit short in my opinion.The build quality is pretty decent, a bit plasticky, but otherwise nice. The Ivory color is different, but I them to be very pleasing to look at. The ear cups are extremely comfortable, with nice velour cushions that I could probably have worn for listening to an entire record maybe even two. My only gripe about the build quality would be that the headband is a bit to easily adjusted.Now for the sound quality. I ended up getting a set of Sennheiser HD 560S and spent an hour or so listening to both of them on the same album, replaying the tracks of the record over and over, first listening to the HD 599s then the HD 560S. The album I was listening to was Wishbone Ash on Deca Records, and recorded on 180 gram vinyl. I also listened to both sets with my equalizer set flat, no adjustments. I found the HD 599s to be lacking in detail, a bit muddy, not as clear over-all and somewhat muffled or toned down. The top end is not as clear and concise as I found the HD 560S set to be. The soundstage of the HD 560S headphones I found to be more complete, spacious and quite good. In short, the HD 599s lack the detail, clarity and soundstage of the HD 560S headphones; if you like a mellow, less punchy sound the HD 599s might be for you. For me I want to hear the same detail and clarity as I'm hearing with my Polk Audio Signature S60 tower speakers hooked up to my Rotel receiver. The HD 560S come pretty close to that sound, but they are slightly less comfortable, which is a bit hard to understand as the build is very similar to that of the HD599s, maybe they will loosen up some and become just as comfortable. Only Time will tell.This is my second try at headphones in the $150 price range, the first pair were the Audio-Technica ATH-M50XGM, which if found to be excellent as far as sound quality, but after a very short period made my ears hurt. So I returned them and after searching and reading reviews, decided to give the HD 599s a try.My suggestion would be to buy all three of these headphones and give them a try. In this price range the HD 560S are my choice. I'd like to keep trying more brands but, not too many out there have the oval ear cups that actually sit completely over the ears. My ears are very sensitive and become sore easily, so the oval cups are a must for me. If you can tolerate a round ear cup, try the Audio-Technica ATH-M50XGM vs the Sennheiser HD560S. Good luck in your choice and happy listening.","June 1, 2022",AHFWSW4APYWHTKLSCLUQ7OOAXBDQ,True,9.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.23224171539961017,Positive,0.9967,Positive
R2R1L0MXABNTXM,B01L1IICR2,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great set of entry audiophile headphones. Warm, articulate sound and well built",Jen,5,"I really like these headphones. They are comfortable, look sleek, have great sound, and respond well to EQ.BUILD QUALITY: I would place these in the higher medium build quality. Very typical Sennheiser feel. They are mostly made of plastic but it’s not cheap plastic. There is absolutely no creaking when twisted and manipulated. They have a premium feel. The leatherette headband is comfortable and adds to the sleekness. The velour ear pads are very soft and comfortable. They don’t make my ears hot at all, making long listening sessions a breeze. The long 9’ cord is thick and durable. I love the length because I can sit comfortable on my couch while I listen. It comes with a shorter 3’ cord for listening on my phone around the house. I would not bring these out in public because they’re open back and everyone will be able to hear what you’re listening to. Don’t be that person.SOUNDSTAGE: I would say the sound stage is medium. Definitely not as wide as some other headphones that I’ve tried such as the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700X, which were TOO big in my opinion, but enough to give the music some space to breathe. They definitely don’t have that closed in soundstage that closed back headphones have where the music feels like it’s right on top of youAUDIO COMFORT: These are very comfortable to listen to. It has a nice warm delivery that make listening to vinyl especially enjoyable. Some people complained about the boomy bass and I will cover that in the next section but compared the the ATH-AD700X, they’re much warmer and not harsh at all the way the ATs were. Regarding vinyl records, these seem to hide surface noise quite well.HIGHS/MIDS/LOWS: One thing to note here is that these seem to respond well to EQ. Many people find these headphones to be too bassy, and they’re half right. Out of the box they do seem a bit boomy but a simple bass adjustment on your EQ will resolve that. All songs are mastered with differing levels of highs, mids, and lows and you have to compensate on your end to make it sound the way you want. His is especially true when going from vinyl to digital sound. Some adjustments are going to need to happen.HIGHS: Highs are articulate without sounding icy.MID SECTION: Again, clear and articulate.LOWS: Lows don’t seem to get lost in the bass.BASS: I am pleased with the amount of bass these produce. I actually would prefer to have a set of headphones like these that have a touch more bass than I want because it’s easier to roll that off on my EQ than to push them to produce more. If the drivers are incapable of it, they just won’t be bassy and it’ll end up muddying up the rest of your sound, sounds I take the more bass as a positiveNOISE ISOLATION: They’re open back so they’re not at all noise canceling or even noise isolating. For this reason I would not recommend using them in public where everyone will be able hear what you’re listening to. These are really designed for at-home listeningFINAL THOUGHTS: These are a great pair of entry level audiophile headphones. I think there’s enough to love here for the price point.","December 31, 2020",AGQ2FSQ2EJJXXJDWNXNLRAQCQLVQ,True,19.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.1860999329309188,Positive,0.9975,Positive

Because there are no freqs in these headphones that give away the pops and crackle of the medium. I bought these to replace my Sony MDR-7506 which are decently priced headphones in the audiophile early range. No compare. The Sony's replicate the high freqs throughout. These 599s are not tailored to this, they seem to be tailored to MASK OUT the frequencies that you typically get with snap, crackle and pop with vinyl/records. I am in the hobby of specifically archiving music from vinyl , so this matters greatly to me. Don't settle for headphones marketed to a specific group who thinks vinyl is the best medium for music.

R3HUW06V6MASE,B01L1IICR2,4.0 out of 5 stars misinformation about Independence and headphone amp etc,LW,4,"(warning: very long, might be boring)I am urged to get it out: I believe there is a lot of misinformation about impedance and headphone amp etc. E.g., many people say low-impedance headphones are easier to drive (than high-impedance ones). This is only partially true: if the output impedance of your device is high, you may find low-impedance headphones harder to drive (since it cannot get enough voltage from the output source, roughly speaking impedance splits voltage).For example, when comparing my HD 6XX to these HD 599, HD 6XX has slightly lower volume on some devices, but they sound about the same on some other devices (with identical volume settings). For HD 569, interestingly, they sound quieter than HD 6XX on one of my old USB sound card (same volume setting) which I suspect have high output impedance. Given that HD 569 has only 23 ohm impedance, it is particularly sensitive to the source’s impedance.I will repeat: low impedance headphones are sensitive to source (the 3.5mm jack)’s output impedance. They may sound very different on different devices. The high-impedance ones are less sensitive: 10 ohm output impedance to 300 ohm headphone impedance is not much different from 1 ohm. But for a pair of 23 ohm headphones, 10 ohm vs 1 ohm is a big difference.That is the other side of coin that is often overlooked: that high impedance headphones work better with high impedance source, the rule of the thumb (according the blog of NwAvGuy, google it), the output impedance should be less than 1/8 of your headphone to not to “color” (change) the sound too much.On a related note, some people say, you need dedicated headphone amp for high-impedance headphones. That again seems wrong: if they are loud enough, adding an amp shouldn’t change the sound! The amp may color the sound if that is what you need. That’s the theory, I never tried an amp, since I am happy with the sound of my HD 6XX and my calculation tells me that that pair does not actually need an amp: HD 6XX is sensitive enough to sound loud enough with ~0.5 vrms output (into 300 ohm). I heard that Samsung S9 can output ~2 vrms into high impedance headphones. On the other hand, for low impedance headphones, you may actually need an amp if you don’t like the way that they sound differently for sources with different impedance. (Personally I just don't like the idea of adding another link between the source and me.)That’s my understanding; you can do your own calculation and try an amp and compare.Finally, back to the sound of HD 599: clean sound with clarify. Comparing to HD 6XX, they seem brighter. Overall I like the sound of HD 6XX better (may simply because I bought them first and I spent more money on them, LOL ...). HD 599 sounds cleaner, but thinner. Reading the frequency response curves, it seems that HD 6xx bumped the 200-4000 hz region which make the vocals stronger: that’s might be the reason why they sound “fuller”. HD 599 might be actually more “accurate”, but I will never know. I don’t have devices to measure. Both are good headphones, sound quality is subjective thing. HD 599 are lighter. I feel that the short cable (1.2m) is too short (the long cable can be used with the provided 3.5mm adapter).Comparing to HD 569, they sound similar. HD 599 might be slightly better. But one key difference is that HD 569 is closed back. You cannot hear yourself well when talking with HD 569 on (and they make your ears sweaty). If you want Skype, you may actually like HD 599 better. But HD 599 does not have the cable with mic (you can use the cable form HD 569 on HD 599, but you don’t want to buy two headphones just for the extra cable ...) So maybe just buy HD 600 and then buy a separate mic.","July 19, 2019",AFYQLYFACIK46DTUNG5FXIJY43MQ,True,1.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.1652490421455939,Positive,0.9955,Positive
R1RWISJ22EJ1LK,B01L1IICR2,4.0 out of 5 stars Good for certain genres,Douglas B.,4,"So I tested these against my reference headphones which are the HiFiMan Ananda. The Ananda's are my preference compared to these HD599s in all genres except Classical music and Metal or anything with heavy electric guitars. I just had a listening session of some Megadeth, Black Sabbath and Soundgarden and these sound pretty good for that purpose, much better than my Grado's for heavy metal. The Grado sound is my preference for ""Classical"" music being anything Baroque, Classical, Romantic, Modern, Post-Modern and Opera. Grado headphones are really excellent for that type of music because they can reproduce the orchestra's Forte (F) with a lot of dynamic excursion of the driver giving the listener the ""jump out of your seat"" moment and feeling when the orchestra hits full force. Grados can do that but the 599s and planar headphones cannot. I tested this with a few tracks from my test track playlist and these HD599s don't have that capability. They don't sound good for pop music either I actually prefer my Anandas for pop music I tested some Lady Gaga off her album Chromatica tracks and these 599s are not on the same level of sound resolution, micro-detail and bass excursion. That said -- the 599s actually have a moderately to very good tonality, although veiled moderately. This is why they probably do so well with heavy metal music or anything with electric guitars. You probably realize that I swap headphones for genres and I do do that. The 599s were a treat to listen to during my testing session on Slaves and Bulldozers by Soundgarden and Age of Reason by Black Sabbath. Although the midrange is forward on the 599s it only really becomes a issue with heavy metal when listening to the loudest sections of the track where you might experience a effect that sounds like clipping. But otherwise these 599s will be my new go-to headphone for anything like Led Zeppelin, Rock, Heavy Metal etc because planars with their lightning quick attack then release and weak guitar tonality don't do good for this type of music. I can also add that the 599s get a 10 out of 10 for comfort they are extremely comfortable and the clamp force does not bother me at all because it's only moderate and not excessive. There's really nothing like hearing Chris Cornell scream ""So bleed your heart out, There's no more rides for free"" and these 599s really gave me a spine tingle when listening to that part of the track. Vocals on these are not crystal clear so know that in advance. The best vocals I've ever heard are on my Anandas. Planars really have a knack at that trick. So despite me only going to be using these for a certain genre I still consider this a good buy and am happy I found a use case for them. This is my first set of Sennheisers.","May 1, 2022",AHF2JMHZL4TGALMDGE2N3VI7YEMQ,True,3.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.18962787212787216,Positive,0.9954,Positive
R157D6PW5AMM7B,B01L1IICR2,4.0 out of 5 stars Comfort Zone,Cesar Camarena,4,"I’ve always been frustrated with the headphone community and they’re scattered reviews but I can say hands down these sound amazing and feel really comfortable. They have an open sound that makes it feel as though you were listening to the concert in person or with the band in the studio. They are warm and add flavor to music instead of the pure recording; but these are for enjoying music not making it. Of course, word of caution, these do need a device with a decent audio driver. I plugged them into my laptop and while it was loud and clear the vocals lacked the higher pitches. I played Shawn Mendez’s song “Higher” and the high note at the end of his song was nonexistent. I connected it to my beefiest amp, an iPod nano; it worked. So the device you plug it into does have a noticiable difference in sound, but out the box and plugged into your phone these are a joy.Advice-the cable is detachable but you have to turn it to the left in order to unhook the inner part of the cable-the ear pads are also removable but they have clips so you have to be careful when replacing them and not just yanking them off.-the adapter for the larger to smaller headphone jack is comically large so I recommend just switching out for the regular jackCons-the only downside is the hinge on both sides of the headphones feels slightly flimsy. It will last but I’d be careful with it, everything else feels top notch! (Sony and boss headphones which cost twice the price have horrible build quality so price doesn’t equal sturdy)-bass isn’t very punchy but an eq helps as with most headphones in this range and style (open-backs don’t typically have powerful bass, if you’re a bass head get Skullcandy wireless headphones they can make your desk vibrate with bass)-they don’t cancel out noise (by design) but when music is playing you don’t hear much at all unless you’re standing right next to traffic or someone’s yelling at you.","July 15, 2023",AFNOKPAUY64PVOBPGP4PS6JMSGWQ,True,21.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.10442658730158734,Positive,0.9856,Positive

Then I plugged them into a DAC AMP and meh went to WOW! These definitely benefit from the extra power of a DAC AMP. I do recommend someplace private because you can easily hear any sound from your surroundings and anyone around you can easily hear what you are listening to because of the open back design. Aside from that these headphones sound really good.

The good thing about these is that I found them VERY comfortable around the ears, and light. But I had hoped for a flat, true to the engineered recording reproduction. The reproduction was not awful, and these are obviously not hi-end cans, however they are advertised as ""audiophile-grade"", ""exceptional sound"", ""excellent dynamics"", which doesn't seem accurate. Particular the dynamics claim. There feels like there is something between me and the sound - I felt ""outside"" the music. In the end I chose comparably-priced Audio Technicas. They come much closer to my JBL 3-way studio monitor speakers than the Sennheisers (not a very fair comparison, but I know the music I tested with extremely well and know what it sounds like when reproduced faithfully.)

RQ9YQIDLC32GH,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid pair of Headphones. In-depth review,Gennady,5,"Amazing product, I don't usually write reviews but this one is worthyWhy I bought the headphones:I play video games and my hyper x cloud alpha s cable was bent so the sound stopped working in one ear. They were about 2 years old so I decided to just upgrade my headphone setup and purchase headphones + a separate mic.Pros:- amazing soundstage- very lightweight- most comfortable ear pads I've ever worn- very good imaging- super easy to drive, so they sound very loud in most games if you need them to be- can wear for hoursCons:- Audiophiles may prefer 560s for less extension in mid-bass- no noise cancelation to speak of. This is nonissue for me, cause I don't need that.- clamping pressure may be too light, so more weight on top of head- plastic frame if you don't like plasticGaming:For gaming, they are insanely good due to the imaging and soundstage. footsteps heard clearly in every direction, great for FPS games. I do recommend using an EQ though to boost the higher frequency sounds especially because footsteps are more treble-sided and the mid-bass is a tad heavy on these. See the image in this post for the EQ settings for gaming that I found work well in games like Valorant. I chose these over the 560s because the soundstage and imaging are better from what I have heard, and for gaming that is more important than a neutral sound.Audiophiles:Consider Sennheiser 560s if looking for more neutral sound. These headphones are a bit warm in the mid-bass area as I've said before, but you can technically fix it with an eq. they are also easier to drive than the 560s. However, the others are technically superior from out the box and only cost an extra 40-50 dollars or so. They may also be better with the higher clamping pressure so more of the 'weight' will be on the side of your head rather than the top.Conclusion:This is a top-tier headphone in the price range (probably the best) for gaming. Much better than any gaming headset, just buy a separate mic for like $30-60 if you need one. Razer siren mini and Fifine k678 are good optionsFor audiophiles, the 560s might be a more neutral option at a very similar price range. Just get those instead unless looking for a warmer sound.","May 27, 2022",AFOPWXPCIGBDZ5SIMAKWZL2SW23A,True,16.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.3658888888888888,Positive,0.9971,Positive

R1JY0DOU4X33T8,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Great starter for audiophile beginners.,M. Henderson,5,"I got these headphones as a upgrade to my Bose Soundtrues I got 3 plus years ago. I heard about Sennheiser open headphones being one of the audiophile standards when wanting great audio, and I read lots of reviews on different ones on RTings.com. So when I decided to venture into the so-called realm of audiophiles, I wanted to do so without breaking the bank. So I looked and looked until I came across these Sennheiser HD599s. These are an upgrade to the HD598, a very popular premium, entry level open back headphone. However, one of the complains about the 598s is that it lacks in bass, this upgrade is supposed to correct that.The design is very premium looking, and I like the color pattern. Many people claim they don't it and prefer the standard black look most headphones have, but I like the cream and silver look. It reminds me of luxury cars like an Audi or a Bentley. The pads are very comfortable and look like the kind of material used in car seats further giving that luxery look. The pads never get irritating after hours of use, nor does the ears get sweaty from the inside, which most plastic foam materials cause. the build is also very sturdy. You'd have to drop these from a decent height more than once to seriously damage them.So how do they sound? In one word, great. These headphones have a well balanced sound with just enough deep bass to standout without being overwhelming. The mid-range is nearly perfect, meaning vocals are not to high and intrusive and not too low where you can't hardly hear them over the music. The treble is excellent. Symbols and other high sounding instruments come through clear without sounding distorted and ear piercing. The sound stage, which open back headphones are best at, is very immersive adding body and fullness to the music. It's for this reason that these headphones are also great for watching movies and playing video games.So are there any cons? Yes, but only a few. One, the headphones do not come with a carrying case, like most headphones do once you start paying well over 100 dollars for them. Second, the headphones come with two cords, a small standard 3.5mm cord for cell phones and the like, and a long 10ft stereo cord. The stereo cord, however, is kind of flimsy and has a receiver style jack at the end. Luckily, there's an adapter included that can change it into another 3.5mm output.Final note: I didn't use any fancy headphone or stereo amps, because these headphones has an impedance of 50, so it doesn't take much to drive. My review is based on using this like any other average headphone in different applications like my PC and Television.Bottomline: These are great open headphones for the price, especially if you are just starting to get into this whole audiophile thing. I know I won't be going back after these babies. My next pair which likely won't be for a while, will be something ever more premium like a Sennheiser 600 series, or a HiFiman, Focal, etc. I checked in and I can't check out.","October 9, 2019",AH223JCI7X2J2VGHNOUHS2AVP42Q,True,6.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.20200520833333332,Positive,0.9983,Positive

RXO5ZFNK2GXH6,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Very good versatile headphones,Linh Nguyen Vu,5,"I am a bigger Sennheiser fanboy than I want to admit. Starting with the HD 555 some 15 years ago, I have owned everything from HD 598, 600 to 800, PC360 gaming headset and MX880 earbuds at different times in life. Never have any of them fallen short of my expectations. Naturally, I expect the 599 to deliver as well.Now, let's get this out the way first. If you want THE best sound quality in this price bracket and couldn't care less about the cheesy Massdrop logo, go on that site and grab yourself a pair of HD58x Jubilee. Like right now, before they go out of stock. I personally haven't tried it, but if it's close to the 600/650, the 599 won't beat it in sound. Period. It's just not supposed to. However, the 599 has other things in its favor that might win you over. Read on.Sound quality: Very good. I have run all my familiar songs through it and nothing jumps out as severely off. Bass can go low and hit hard unlike the anemic 598, but there is no rumble as you might hear on any high end Denon/Fostex headphones (old or new), which is expected from an open-back design. Mids are the star of the show, very prominent and not at all recessed. Guitar and vocals come through clearly and naturally; distorted electric guitar in particular sounds incredible - trust me, I play too. Treble extends nicely and unfortunately doesn't cope well with overly sibilant recordings. The overall sound signature can be described as fun, intimate and engaging. It's great for just about any genre of music and general gaming (I don't play competitive but I bet these would work unless you need a mic).Comfort: I can have these on for hours without any discomfort. Not many headphones can stay for more than one hour without hurting the top of my head, so that's a plus.Vs. HD 600: no real comparison. The 600's sound profile is quite different. It is not as in your face, but very balanced sounding and highly resolving of details. I run a complex song through the 600 back then and the 599 now, which involves the singing melody being echoed and delayed on one side, along with the main melody in the center. On the 600 I can hear all of the echoed/delayed words, however on the 599 I can hear maybe 60% of them and they come off as incoherent. If you buy headphones just to pick at the details like I used to, the 599 isn't it. Its overpowering mids and slightly grainy presentation prevents it from hanging with the big boys. What it DOES let you do is just sit down and enjoy the music as a whole, for the low price of $160-170 vs. $300 of the 600.So there you have it. Get the 58x if you mainly listen to music, especially if not EDM/rock/metal. For mixed usage (music, gaming) and comfort, the 599 takes it. It is positioned nicely in what I call the ""transitional"" price point, where you go from not knowing any better to trash talking Beats. Its sound profile allows it to handle most modern music well with few caveats. Definitely recommend.","August 25, 2019",AGOUKUXX2EWLL627WCQ7LW63JTGA,True,8.0,Style: HD 599,Sennheiser,0.16673913979884128,Positive,0.9947,Positive
RO11ZOF05NUJR,B01L1IICR2,4.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser HD 599 SE Comfortable wearing headphones...,Gary,4,"Well, I purchased the Sennheiser HD 599 SE stereo headphones here on this Amazon link over 3 months ago for a whopping 60% off the $199 retail, and it's good thing I did, or I would have returned them.. Let me explain, (since I did give it a 4 star rating!). The headphones are very comfortable and the quality is reasonable. I literally had to set the 100 Hz bass shelf at -6 dB to approach a balanced, neutral sounding headphone. Even at that, they are a slight bit dipped at 1kHz, but have an acceptable sound signature for many listeners with that EQ. The clarity or sparkle up top that people like is there on the HD 599SE's, but not too excessive. The efficiency is good for a 55 ohm impedance headphone. I would not purchase these headphones for mixing or studio, though. They were a great deal for what I paid, and sound nice on various music programs, but with attention paid to the bass EQ. I recently purchased AKG k240 studio's on sale for even less than I paid for these Sennheisers, and they were much more neutral, which will come in handy for me. Note that the AKG k240 studio's were less efficient than expected for their 55 ohm impedance, but worked acceptable fine at my mixing desk. The Sennheiser HD 599 SE's may be good for you if you like excessive bass, but then, you may be better suited to the Audio Technica ATH-M50x's, which sound good too, but are not really studio headphones either, imho, but Sennheiser doesn't seem to make that claim like Audio Technica does..

R30QPADGP9UE6,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars good open-back headphones for gaming and listening,Adrian,5,"These headphones have been reliable and have good audio quality and spatial sound. They are open back, so they have some bleed on the outside and limited noise cancellation, but they are still usable on a plane or in traffic, and the bleed usually isn't noticeable in public. This downside is exchanged for a wider and richer soundspace.One thing that annoyed me was that the 2.5mm cables that come with the headphones have a certain way of locking in with bumps inside the jack on the headphones. This may prevent you from plugging in other cables to it. I wanted to use a longer coiled cable I got online, so I just broke off the locking bumps with a flathead screwdriver. If you remove the bumps, the original cable will lose its locking feature but you can plug any 2.5mm connector into them and it will have the strength of a regular jack. Personally, I would rather have a cable that can break loose than one that is locked in and potentially rip out / damage the headphones.","February 2, 2024",AHUVB66G54RBB537GGYXRZN6P5YA,True,2.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.04787087912087913,Positive,-0.639,Negative

R11YPY8ZSP6X22,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the best headphones under $300,Nathan,5,"These are probably the best headphones I've ever tried. These have one of the widest, most precise soundstages of anything anywhere near this price range, with anything else that gets close either lacking in sound or comfort.These are also some of the most comfortable headphones you can get; open backs with big cups, velour earpads, and without a strong clamp.I'll compare these to some similar headphonesThe Sennheiser 6xx/650 has a bit more detail, but almost no soundstage and have an annoyingly tight clamp and get warm on my head. Highs are a bit rolled off, leaving the 599 to sound a tad clearer.The Philips SHP9500 sound a bit weird in the mids and overall feel like there's two speakers on your shoulders, rather than being truly surrounded in the sound. The massive pads are constantly in contact with half of your face, and they never let me forget that they were still on. A lot of people like these, but imo the 599s are leaps and bounds better, I have no reason to use the 9500s since I have the 599s.The AKG K702 are also fairly close to the sound of the 599, but I'm not a fan of their build quality or how they feel on my head (pads are a bit shallow, your ears touch the fabric covering the driver). They may be slightly wider, but they aren't the most comfortable, so I find them distracting from what I'm listening to. I'd still pick the 599 over these.The Fidelio X2HR is probably the closest to the 599 out of everything I've tried. They're a bit warmer and wider, but less precise. They're in the same tier of comfort as the 599, and I use these if I don't want all the precision of the 599. I got the 599s for $100 and X2HRs for $120, but now that the 599s are a bit more expensive, you could save a few bucks and be almost as happy with the X2HR.The Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro (80 ohm) is the most different in terms of sound (and the only closed pair on this list), but it's in the same price range and at the same caliber. If I need to focus and theres some background noise, I pick these. They have more and tighter bass than the 599, and are immensely more isolating, costing only a bit of soundstage. Well built and comfortable. The best closed-backs I've tried so far. If you want the 599 in a closed back version, I'd recommend these. I tried to like the 598cs for a good year and I could never get used to their sound signature.I got lucky and got these for $100, and for that price, theres no competition. But at their current price around $160-$200, you can start looking around a bit more (or get them used for ~$120). From all that I've tried and read, these are easily one of the best pairs of headphones under $200 (and under $300 if you like soundstage). Every new pair I try is compared to these, and so far, these haven't been beat.","October 1, 2019",AHF6TG5A6HSW7GKUN5BZVEJMQ4PA,True,115.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.24056489958129307,Positive,0.9969,Positive

I like the discontinued 598s grit and the entire sound spectrums balance. The mids are hidden in these 599s due to the added bass. Some really like it tho. I'm a mid head. Bass has to be tamed to catch the mids, and Sennheiser has excellent midrange. The 598s can be had for a great price on the other website. Hope this helps. Bass heads will probably love this.

R3PBV1MAODCNQS,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars 4.5 stars,J. F. Hindy,5,"I upgraded to these from the Sennheiser HD 558s. It's been a mostly positive experience.Pros1. The sound is fantastic. The highs are high, the mids are mid, and the lows are low. There is a surprising amount of thump for it being an open ear headphone. There is good representation across most frequencies.2. The earpads are lush and comfortable.3. The design is hit or miss, but I like it. You don't get cream and brown much anymore. It makes them look distinctive.4. The box comes with two cables. One unreasonably long cable with a 6.3mm jack and a 3.5mm converter and a normal 3 meter headphone jack with a 3.5mm end.5. 50ohm impedance means they're relatively easy to drive.Neutral1. The sound stage isn't quite as big as the 558 or the 598. That's entirely up to personal preference. It's still a good sound stage, it just doesn't sound as wide.2. There is very obviously some tuning in the bass and treble. These are somewhat flat but with a very obvious bass and treble boost. They're not V shaped, more like a really shallow U. It's definitely not subtle but it's not insane either.3. These do have some clamp to them. If it's enough great. If it's too much, you can stretch them out a bit using a few books stacked like they're on a book shelf. Leave it there for 12 hours or so and they'll loosen up. My 558s had a similar clamp and after a tiny bit of stretching they sit on my head better.Cons1. The head strap could've used some more cushioning. It's not uncomfortable but compared to the pillow they put on the 558s, these are definitely more noticeable on your head.2. I'm not sure if these sound better amped or not. On some tracks, like Pink Floyd's Pulse album or the Final Fantasy XV soundtrack, these amped is an amazing experience. However, listening to Sublime with Rome while these are amped make their already overpowered bass guitar even more so and it drowns out some other parts of the track. Without an amp, Sublime with Rome sounds amazing. It's a weird conundrum. When amped, turning up the sound makes the music sound cluttered and overwhelming. A problem I never had with my 558s. These are definitely not relaxed sounding.Overall, for $250, these are okay. If you can get them on sale, go for it, but I'm still not certain I want to take the hit to my wallet for what I'm getting here. They're very, very good headphones and I'll give them a week, but the more tracks I listen to, the more I think that these may not be for me.

R3KREE77ZUA9HG,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing headphones!,MSA,5,"I needed high end headphones, to really take advantage of the new Hi Res Lossless Audio formats, just out from the big streaming music providers. If you have Amazon Music, Apple Music, Tidal, etc., you can now listen to music the way it was meant to be heard. I am not beating up on MP3’s, as they revolutionized the way we listen, and they needed to be compressed, to be able to be downloaded, and stored, with what was available, when they took off.As much as I want, and will be adding a set of Noise Cancellation Headphones, they are really designed for Bluetooth use. Most do have a hard wired 3.5mm cord available, and you can use them, but as of right now, you cannot get these lossless audio files by Bluetooth, as the files are too large.Of course you can spend $1,000 plus on wired headphones, but I researched what would give me a good idea of the quality of the lossless audio, but wanted to start slowly, so I could decide if these were adequate, and I could get the new breed of Noise Cancellation, especially for Air Travel, next.These did not disappoint at all. I know this is sometimes a cliché, but I truly can hear things that I never heard before, in my favorite music. Each thing I listen to, is like listening for the first time. I cannot recommend these more highly. Keep in mind, these are Open Back, so you will hear some external noise, and if you listen at higher volume, people will hear what you are listening to. So these are not suitable if you work in a busy office, but are great if you use these in privacy, but still want a little external sound, like you have to know if you phone rings, etc. Enjoy!","July 9, 2021",AEE62OCZYHOUZBWJKRKJQIDC7S3Q,True,1.0,Style: HD 599 SE,Sennheiser,0.20492525703463202,Positive,0.9882,Positive

The build quality is pretty poor, but for good reason, they are incredibly light, so the plastic construction is at least somewhat justified.When they work they are fantastic, but the drivers, at least in my case, do not last. Sonova Consumer charges you return shipping when you RMA them, so I've input about 30 extra dollars into these headphones than the original asking price, but the company did have a fairly fast turnaround time for the headphones, taking less than two weeks from the day I shipped them to receive what looked like a brand new pair with accessories.

R12ZM3ZBDMA2L1,B01L1IICR2,5.0 out of 5 stars I think a very big number one for VJ headphones.,Audrey,5,These are very nice headphones and they sound real good for VJ headphones and especial if using a microphone because they sound like they are sloped up in the midrange about 2.5 decibels and that makes them a big number one to me for VJ headphones and that's what I was purchasing them for and found they work very good. I think the cables should be 2 meters and do like they are lasi coiled up because those fray and so do cables that are too short sooner also and some might like the cable length to be around 2.5 meters because they stand also and so 2.5 meters might be the most practical cord length that has ever existed for headphones. Also on the headphones they are open back and wish that closed back in the same design exist someday and the open back they are a little louder around the outside of them then some closed back headphones and yet they are still pretty quiet and yet being a pretty big easy number 1 choice for VJ headphones I think they should also be offered in closed back with the same look and design and feel and by that I mean comfort and the sound capability of the headphones. I wear three sets of studded earrings in both my left and right ears and these headphones clear those and so wearing those kinds of earrings for me is very comfortable and I lasi have to take them out of my ears.

So far they are worth every penny. Sound, comfort, feel, battery life, etc. I highly recommend them. Just maybe be aware of when you put them on and take them off. Pre-bending the headband at the top, just a little bit, if needed, is the only thing I would recommend seeing as how every failure has been due to the cheap plastic holding the ear cuff to the headband of the headphones. with that one part being fixed. it would be the perfect headphone.","July 6, 2024",AHTPEW2E2DCF2KEUNQYVYLWIHUVQ,True,12.0,Color: GreySize: One SizeStyle: Headphones,Skullcandy Crusher,0.1144426406926407,Positive,0.7837,Positive

R2XRCKO46LIP8O,B0CD1F3WCC,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good,Dave M,4,"Let me start by saying I have been rocking the same set of original Crusher headphones since like 2014. They still work perfectly, but with the current sale having been announced, I decided to add these to my collection (along with my original crusher and aviator sets). I am genuinely impressed by the sound quality, especially the bass, which sounds much more full and clean than the OG crushers. However, there are a few things that bug me.1.) The included headphone bag is garbage. Super thin and cheap feeling. The original crushers came with a heavy duty nylon bag that was lined with Sherpa. I will be using that bag over the one included with the crusher evos, zero doubt about that. My question is why. Why include a lightning phone charger, which probably has an approximate market value of $20-30+ instead of a good carrying case/bag. Makes no sense.2.) Still using the same cheap PU leather material for the ear pieces. Again, seems like a dumb move. The only part of my original crushers that has degraded over time is the ear covers, and that's with me only using them when I am NOT sweating. Comfortable, but certainly not durable.3.) they changed the buttons. Just.. why? Why does the power button need to be separate from the pause/play button, which has no other function? Used to be that the pause/play button was the power button, you just held it down. Changing this was not necessary.3.) can't hold the volume button to increase/decrease volume, it changes the song now. I much preferred double tapping the +/- sign to change songs, being able to hold the volume button one way or the other was vastly preferable to the new system. Now, if you hold the button, it changes the song. Again, why? I have to press the volume button 17 times to adjust it instead of just holding the button down. Stupid.Overall, the sound quality has vastly improved, especially with the personalized sound available in the app (which is brilliant and works oh so well), but I'm not a fan of the new button design or the obvious compromises they made with the case and included cables. The cables included feel cheap, I will not be using them. It's 2024, who doesn't have a decent braided USB-C cable? They included a bottom of the barrel, cheap as it gets charging cable for the headphones while including a lightning charger, which makes no sense considering Apple is doing away with the lightning charging system in the near future thanks to the EU legal case against them.4 stars. It would be 5 if the included case wasn't a POS and the included cables weren't as cheap as it gets.","August 22, 2024",AG2G7RXM2Q7OA2ZNVR37SF6KLYGQ,True,2.0,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones,Skullcandy Crusher,0.1902573579460372,Positive,0.983,Positive

R2DBP4MRXLMLV9,B0CD1F3WCC,5.0 out of 5 stars Crazy amount of bass,Jamaican Guru,5,"These headphones have incredible punch, relentless bass, you can feel it through your body and that's not an exaggeration. In ranges where the bass is comfortable, it gets very bassy and sounds very nice. These headphones are worth buying. You love bass? You gotta get these. You want to feel and sound like you're at a party? Get these. I've gone through many headphones, Sennheiser, Sony Xb, b&o, etc, and none of them have the earth shattering bass these do. The sensory bass is seamless and whatever tuning they did to incorporate it and let it match the bass that's playing is impressive. One of a kind experience and everyone should experience these.Now that I've said all of that and ive paid fair respects to the product and what it does... Let's talk negatives. Mids and highs are just okay, at times it sounds muddy even with the bass slider completely off, despite the fact that these headphones aren't even very loud. This is very apparent after using the b&o EX earbuds for the last few months. The clarity is nowhere near those earbuds, but then again those earbuds are also $350. Point is their focus clearly wasn't on the rest of the sound but primarily the bass which is totally understandable...HOWEVER, there is one issue I have noticed and I know audiophiles and more critical music listeners, people who have used higher quality headphones and earbuds will for sure notice this. But the lows, are not great, I'm talking the really lows. My understanding here is that the driver unit itself isn't good at producing very low frequency bass, the type of bass that makes you feel pressure even when it's not loud. So the additional mechanism that's inside of the headphone, doesn't do anything when those really low frequency bass plays. And what you end up with is a very apparent drop off in volume and intensity and it's very noticable and makes the headphones sound normal when they are trying to reproduce very low bass. I can say this with certainty, the EXs, the momentums, the Sony Xb, these all produce a richer deeper bass response in the lower frequencies. This is a little disappointing since these are purpose built for bass. IDK how they can circumvent that, mabye better drivers or more tuning on the sensory mechanism to make it simulate the lows even if the drivers can't replicate them. Either way, it's very apparent. A good test is a song called "" Bass I love you"". When it reaches the lows, the sound just dies. These produce the loudest bass I've heard of felt in headphones/earbuds and I mean it when I say the bass hits you with purpose, your friends will all be impressed and they won't even know its not all real bass.. but they are not the richest nor deepest bass headphones I've heard sadly. Keep this in mind and understand what you're purchasing and you won't be disappointed.

R3G5UNY7FFMCAI,B0CD1F3WCC,5.0 out of 5 stars Unexpectedly massive Bass 🤘,Justin,5,"So, I legitimately purchased these based on the reviews, since they were good overall and said the bass was surprising for the low cost. When I first put them on, I could tell that there was substantial bass, but overall wasn't very loud even though my volume on my phone was max. I was immediately disappointed, but then I decided to try the volume buttons on the headphones and it WENT FREAKING HAM on some sound!! I was grinning ear to ear and completely floored by the amount of bass blasting into my ear holes. My dinner got cold because I sat for over and hour repeating the cycle of ""Oh! I wonder what ____ song would sound like on these"" and I am still in that endless zone as I type this review...

These headphones are by far my favorites to travel with, the volume and bass levels are easily controllable although I don't even touch the bass setting now that I have it set to where I'm comfortable with it. They're not noise cancelling which isn't ideal but that's the only ""negative"" I have about them and I bought them well knowing they're not noise cancelling so it's a non issue for me.","August 19, 2024",AHDKNSXPR2V3TMPTCPU255Q5QBGA,True,0.0,Color: GreySize: One SizeStyle: Headphones,Skullcandy Crusher,0.1803030303030303,Positive,0.7384,Positive
R3022NUB5G5JE3,B0CD1F3WCC,4.0 out of 5 stars Everything you want!,Christopher Martinez,4,I had the Skull candy ANC that were discontinued and they went bad after 4 years.So I decided to buy these Evo. From what I can tell they are almost identical. The build quality is the same or even slightly better for the Evo which is an odd choice from Skullcandy since the ANC were like 300 when they came out and 200 when discounted.The most important part for me was the haptic bass and that does not disappoint. For $99 dollars it was the best headphones purchase I made.Even though they have fewer features than the ANC I had they still deliver where it counts and that's the bass.These headphones are the best for movies on your phone or laptop and best gym headphones you can have.In comparison when I bought the ANC that were discontinued they were $200 on discount. They had ANC/ambient mode and played a bit louder and were compatible with some android Sound software that I can't remember the name for.The only thing I wish these Evo had that the ANC had is the compatibility with that Software because it did make them sound slightly better.That said the Evo give you the bass for half the price when on discount. They give your more hours of battery life.One thing I appreciate is these don't have the static buzz in the background like the ANC.I can't tell you how they compare to the New ANC 2's but I can tell you they are worth it at $99 dollars and I would choose than over anything else in that price range or below.The comfort isn't the best. They are pretty tight with the clamping force and I don't have a big head. So if comfort is a priority than you probably should try these out somewhere or just buy something else.,"June 18, 2024",AFLN332V4EJLM7CUWKXBUYZ2OZRA,True,1.0,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones,Skullcandy Crusher,0.25865800865800864,Positive,0.9858,Positive

After much research between big name brands, reviewers said one thing. Nothing comes close to the Crusher Evos thumping bass. When I tried them for the first time, I was laughing at how powerful the bass felt.

However, nothing I have ever used before comes close to even comparing with these headphones. Astounding experience, and maybe the best 100 bucks I have ever spent.

R1O1SXKW78SFEE,B0CD1F3WCC,5.0 out of 5 stars Feels like Kicker L7's on your Head!,Francisco p.,5,"Ok I'm a bass lover I grew up on putting a milli on repeat bc of how heavy the bass is, and these headphones brings back that memory of when my uncle had 2 15in Kicker L7's in the truck. OMG YouTube videos don't do these headphones justice. Literally shaking my face fat and glasses bc of how much Bass there is. One gripe I can list is the media functions is strange. You have to hold the up volume button for next track and the lower volume button for previous track. The industry standard since the screen less iPod shuffle is 2 presses for next track and 3 presses for previous. Not sure why skullcandy couldn't stick to the norm but I guess it's to be unique. Also my headset came with a extra charger and little nice touch it looks like a lime green legacy keyboard connector. For those who dob is after limewire it's the connection keyboards used before USB. This headset is well worth the purchase, even more if you get it less than the retail $200. I'm glad I chose these over something mediocre like airpods pro max or Bose quiet comfort etc etc, these are for those bass heads who used to crack the bass settings in the car to the max. The plastic materials that make up 70% of the headset keeps these light and the matte finish modernizes the aesthetics. There's a metal band that makes the headset able to adjust wide enough for those with wider heads. These arent the ANC versions but who needs that when you have bass and volume to the max. Wrapping up the review, bass is amazing, app is only for battery visuals and requires location on to use 🙄 but you can get by without it. Now I don't have to spend thousands on my car to get those Subs installed since theses headphones give me that Bass itch for less.","May 19, 2024",AFNJ3UWASOWPOFCYRUFXPQLBVCUQ,True,16.0,Color: BlackSize: One SizeStyle: Headphones,Skullcandy Crusher,0.020382882882882883,Positive,0.9827,Positive
R2CD3PL3F67KK4,B0CD1F3WCC,4.0 out of 5 stars Sounds Good :),Megan,4,"TLDR; Bought at 100 dollars (half off deal). Amazing charge with 3-4 days, over 48 hrs and still at 60%. Sound is very clear, though i’m not an audiophile. The sound leaks, though, when in use. Even when below half volume. Worth 100 maybe 160. Unsure if it’s worth 200+.I was a little weary of this product. I had a (pre-owned) WH-1000XM4, color Navy, before these headphones. So far, I really enjoy the sound. Connected to phone easy, the app for these headphones is good!!I’m no audiophile, but from other reviews I was TERRIFIED these wouldn’t sound good. In my opinion?? Very good sound!! I don’t have to turn volume up too much, the bass slider is a LIFE SAVER, and everything is SO MUCH better than my Airpods (2nd gen). I don’t think it’s on par with my WH-1000XM4 - but they had ANC. These do not.I bought these half off - shipping and handling brought the total to 108$. So I think they’re worth that price?? Absolutely!! The bass DOES in face make your brain vibrate.Does the 200 dollar OG price seem fair? Mmh. Unsure. I think if it was ANC, I’d agree with it. But, so far - as I’ve just got them today - I think maybe 150 is the fair price/max I’d personally pay for them. :)Month Update: Changed from 5 to a 4. Still really good!! (For the half off price of 100). It holds up when working out - nothing strenuous, just treadmill at incline of 5.0 and speed of 3.5mph. Holds up on a bike (indoor) and an elliptical. The audio leak on this thing is HORRENDOUS though. I have it below half volume and i can still hear it a few feet away in a semi-quiet environment. It’s awful.Features are still amazing, i don’t use the app too much tho other than when i first set it up. They hold up a charge SUPER well. I wear headphones nearly 24/7 and they last at least 3-4 days and go to only about 60 percent, even with around 48+ hours of use.

The Beats sound great and they have noise canceling and so on, however for me, they just don't have enough bass. So I did some researching and ran across these Scullcandy crusher evos. According to the reviews people claim that the bass on these were amazing, so I figured what the heck I will try them. I got them today. I'm thinking they will sound like the Beats studio pro with a little bit more bass. I connected these bad boys to my phone and the sound was amazing and definitely better that the Beats, but guess what, I wasn't done. You see, there is a slide control on the left ear cup to adjust the bass sensory, this my friends is the big difference maker. When you add bass sensory to your music..... OMG !!!! I really can't describe it. I have had many pairs of headphones and earbuds and I have never in my life heard bass like this coming from headphones. Now don't get me wrong this will not be for everyone, this is strictly for bass heads and If you don't know what a bass head is then these headphones are probably not for you.","June 23, 2024",AFQOBJMADAXNJRYYT2YBDD3OKNJQ,True,6.0,Color: GreySize: One SizeStyle: Headphones,Skullcandy Crusher,0.11908804086538469,Positive,0.9723,Positive

R206RFYPZF50QL,B0BS74M665,5.0 out of 5 stars Must get!! Great deal and solid quality for Price,Katie,5,"First and foremost, I have had these headphones for a few months and now feel comfortable giving a solid review.I truly love these headphones. I am not exaggerating when i say i use these daily. The sound quality is great (it’s obviously not the best ever but for $99 it’s a 10/10 for me). They completely cover your ears, and there is very minimal noise leak when they are on your head which i was very concerned about. They are also super lightweight and don’t hurt your head. They are easy to use and pair. Also another GREAT thing is the latency is great too. I’m an avid YouTube watcher and if the sound wasn’t matching with the voices these would have gone RIGHT BACK however, the latency is basically non existent. The final thing that is GREAT..AMAZING about these is the charge. It will hold a charge for DAYS. I kid you not, they have never once died on me. I work from home so i will have them on and in use all day long and i swear on my life they will only be 70% by the end of the day!! These are truly a solid pair of headphones and worth every penny! They also come with a cord so you can have them corded as well. Also as far as people have told me, the microphone pics up your voice just fine. The noise cancellation option is great too. I liken them to Beats in that regard. They also get hella loud!My only issues would be that they do FEEL kinda cheap but the performance outshines that. Also they do not listen for Siri commands and as far as i know you can’t change the song or go back on a song with the headphones. Not a huge deal, however something that i took note of.Get these if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive pair of over-ear headphones that are good quality.","April 22, 2024",AH7JGWBUK4ENW3ZIZU56EJAOAEEQ,True,74.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.2573346560846561,Positive,0.9944,Positive
R2POMI5PGBQPLX,B0BS74M665,"5.0 out of 5 stars Best Headphones I Ever Owned, Especially for the Money",Zachary Woodman,5,"I have spent years fighting to find a decent pair of bluetooth headphones since no phone manufacturer wants to make a decent phone with a jack anymore (which is endlessly stupid, but I digress). I have tried everything form fancy expensive Galaxy Buds to a myriad of budget options, and all have the same problems. Flawed connectivity, noticeably glitchy, slightly reduced sound quality.These finally fix it. The inclusion of an option to use a headphone jack on devices that let you is a great feature. Along with multipoint connect. They fit perfectly around my skinny neck (your mileage may very on that), so travel with them is a breeze. And for the sound quality, these are absolutely the best headphones for your money.I was loathe to go to overears full time because I like being able to take one out to hear my surroundings, and every noise passthrough I used before was sucky. (usually the outside noise obnoxiously trebley). Not with these. I actually go to concerts to listen with my headphones on because it actually makes the concerts sound better than with no headphones. Extremely convincing, near perfect noise passthrough.The app is easy to use and has a great selection of features: from custom EQs, to adjusting the noise pass through, to other various quality of life settings. The 3D adaptive sound feature is great, though a little tricky to set up at first, and noise cancellation is very good, though not the best in the world. The battery life is also almost unbelievable. I use these headphones a lot--sometimes all day--and I still only have to charge them once or twice a week. Multipoint connection is also a very nice plus if, say, I am working at my computer and still want to be able to answer phone calls hands-free.There are some minor flaws with them, though. First sometimes very low bassey notes from the outside world can trigger the speakers in them and give you very loud, deep popping noises. (E.g., this occasionally happens when I am riding in the car and hitting bumps in the road). Occasional outside sounds in passthrough through will sound muddled. Also the noise cancellation--while quite good--isn't perfect for every situation. Specifically, it has more trouble than, say, Bose headphones with loud, sudden sounds like fireworks. But for the money, it is still the best noise cancellation and passthrough system you can buy.Another (minor) complaint, though, is that the adaptive settings aren't always very great. It often thinks I am sitting and automatically turns on noise cancellation when I am very much driving or walking around town or once even ice skating--all situations where passthrough is crucial. And even if I am sitting, sometimes I really want passthrough on (like if I'm in a cafe), but it automatically tries to turn noise cancelling on annoyingly. Thankfully, it can be easily overridden in the app. These days, I usually just keep the adaptive sound setting off and adjust the settings to fit the situation but sometimes it will randomly go back to automatic/adaptive mode.My final and complaint is with the microphone for phone calls. Sometimes it works perfectly and the other line can hear my fine, sometimes all they can hear is background noise, sometimes they really can't hear me at all. I am not sure if it is some sort of firmware issue or if the microphone placement is just too far from my mouth, but for phone calls it can be a tad unreliable. When it works, which is around 75% of the time, it's perfectly good even though I have to talk a little louder than I normally would sometimes.But all those flaws aside, these are probably the best all-around headphones I have owned and for the $120 I paid for them it's a steal. They may be more expensive as I got them on sale, but I have used headphones multiple times the price that are poorer quality and less functional than these. I'd have paid upwards of twice the price for what I got.","May 22, 2023",AGMWH7HS3PQFXRDYXMTVGLO7PWKA,True,255.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.2060486891385767,Positive,0.9982,Positive

R1DDQWQ0G2V7AA,B0BS74M665,5.0 out of 5 stars GREAT Headphones for ANYTHING!,Brennon,5,"The 720n headphones are a great pick for the price! Being Sony, the performance is GREAT. There is only one flaw, and it is the noise cancelling. The noise cancelling is great for the price, but it doesn’t cancel out everything. Most everything it cancels out though. Now for appearance. The 720n’s appearance doesn’t really have much to it. Just black, white, or ?blue?. As appearance, the 720n’s have a 3.5 port for Xbox, PlayStation, PC, etc though the 3.5 port only works when the headphones are powered off. I love that with the Headphones Connect app, you can customize almost everything with the headphones (you can even connect 2 devices simultaneously). The 720n headphones have Alexa built in, which doesn’t work the BEST. When it works, it’s good. The headphones ear part moves flat. I forgot to mention that the headphones also feature Ambient Sound mode which uses the mics on the headphones and amplifies it in your ears so it’s not as muffled.

R3K75VFAABFOTQ,B0BS74M665,"3.0 out of 5 stars Decent product, not sure what I think about the quality.",Seattleite,3,"I didn’t expect much, but the “lightweight” aspect makes me think the plastics aren’t as durable as I would hope.As having had plenty of headsets/headphones in the past, I can say the one point of failure is poorly designed/inherently flawed plastics. Some are very durable, some aren’t, and because there aren’t very many reassurances about the quality/durability I think I’m going to return these and try for a higher-end set.There’s also a couple issues I will mention; the cups turn outward -instead of the ear muffs turning towards your chest when you have them around your neck, they turn outward, leaving the plastic to lean against your skin. This might not be a big issue to you, but for me it clanks against my jewelry, and just seems out of place compared to other models I’ve used. The bracket for the band to the cups also sticks out farther than expected, hitting things further out from my head than I’m used to. The muffs are also not really meant for use in the summer as you will get sweaty and moist in there (issue solved with just switching to some earbuds.)Over all a great headset for the price. The active noice cancellation is a cool feature, and it charges quickly. The usb-c is also good to see, as well as the wired cable (only ~~3.5/4ft) for us suffering iPhone users who don’t have headphone jacks :’(.Don’t let my review lead you astray, sony makes some great pieces of gear, which are worth checking out for yourself.","September 4, 2024",AHDSXYRASTQSFAOMEHHNHZ3D73WA,True,2.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.12041666666666666,Positive,0.9704,Positive
RL93HUK667R9P,B0BS74M665,5.0 out of 5 stars A lot to love at a decent price,Brian,5,"SECOND UPDATE - 11/9/2023 OK, so I have been living with these for a couple of months now and I feel I can say some things with more confidence.1. Comfort is still a bit hit or miss. I will say the choice to put those microphones or whatever those things that stick out on the insides of the earcups was not great. I don't always feel them pressing on my ears but the earpads are not very thick and if you don't have them on in exactly the right way (assuming you can find a way that works for you) then the pads will flatten a bit and you'll feel them on your ears. It's not exactly painful. Just unpleasant. 2. And I feel the need to come back to the ear cushions themselves. Again, they just barely fit over my ears. And I wear glasses so this is a big issue with most headphones. I can sometimes get the cushions just right so they don't smash the tips of my ears against the arms of my glasses too much but it sometimes takes a bit of extra fiddling around with them that can be annoying when I'm not in the mood for it. Again, not too much of a knock against Sony since this is a widespread issue with headphones in general. Manufacturers just seem to think if they make the cushions soft, they will be comfortable. Nope. If it smashes your ears, it will start to hurt after a while no matter how soft it is.3. The battery life is decent but I do find myself having to charge them more often than I expected. Prior to these, I had an inexpensive pair of Jlab headphones and although their sound quality and features were lacking, the battery life was outstanding and I was just used to not charging for days and days. I pretty much wear headphones all day every day and I generally find that these will be at 50% after a couple of days. Of course that's with noise cancelling on. But also, these are noise cancelling headphones so they were designed to be used with it on for long periods. Or should have been. I don't know what the capacity of the battery is in these but the battery packs they use in wireless headphones are not expensive items anymore. You can buy a set of $30 wireless headphones now with a huge capacity battery. So, yes. These are lower end Sony but they're still well above the price you pay for really basic wireless headphones. They shouldn't have skimped on the battery capacity. That said, though I haven't actually kept track of how many hours, it probably does meet the stated runtime. I had just hoped they were being conservative with the numbers. But also, you can't use them and charge them at the same time so if you use your headphones constantly, that can be annoying. I don't like to run lithium batteries much below 50%. I don't know that it's bad for them exactly but all of my lithium batteries have lasted me for many years using that policy so that's what I do. When I see 40-50% I charge the battery. I know they have the quick charge feature but I like to charge and forget for many hours. It would be more useful if I could plug into a power bank for 15 minutes and still use the headphones while it's charging. But nope. You plug into a charger and the headphones turn off. Everything said, I'm reasonably happy with them but I paid the $150 asking price they were selling for when I bought them. Knowing all I know now, I would not pay that price again for these. These are $70 headphones. Tops. They're not that comfortable. The battery life is easily matched (or surpassed) by the least expensive wireless headphones on Amazon. The stock sound quality is not impressive at all. (I will say they sound pretty good if you tweak the EQ). The only things I have been really happy about is once I got them paired with my PC, they always connect right away when I turn them on. That's something that is hit or miss with most bluetooth devices. And can be incredibly annoying when you have to fight to get something connected every single time. I've also been pretty satisfied with the noise cancelling. Which they're the first NC headphones I've ever owned so I have nothing to compare them to. I'm not really understanding what Sony was trying to do with these. Their top of the line ANC headphones might be some of the best ANC but are they really $400 good? Well, if they're anything like these, they are good but significantly overpriced.UPDATE - 9/25/2023 I realize my original review is a bit long and probably most people don't want to read all that so after living with these for a week or so, here are some key points that I think people will want to know.1. Comfort is just OK for people with small or medium ears that don't stick out too far. Beyond that, the comfort might be anything from uncomfortable to painful.2. The ANC is good enough for me. I don't fly. I don't use them on a bus or train or anything. I use them at home. They block out things like computer fans and voices in adjacent rooms. I have a fan right by my head and although I can still hear it, the ANC really tames it to a very gentle hiss. If voices or TV are in the same room with you, it will cause them to seem to recede quite a bit but you will still probably hear them (especially TV). The ANC works better on some frequencies than others. It almost eliminates some noises but (for example) the sound of water running nearby is something you will definitely hear.3. I use these 90% with my Windows 10 PC and I have not experienced any of the disconnection issues that many have reported with them as long as I am only using them with my PC. However, when I do connect them to my Android phone, if I leave them connected for a while, things can get glitchy and if I then turn off the bluetooth on my phone, it will sometimes make weird things happen. Like if I have the ANC turned on on the headphones, it will turn off and forget the EQ settings I have chosen. Also, sometimes when I try to disconnect them from the phone by simply turning off bluetooth, they don't make the disconnect sound. I don't know. I'm glad I didn't buy them to use exclusively with the phone. I have a different set of headphones for that. I just wanted to include this in my review to note that I did indeed notice some issues when I left them connected to my phone for a while. I will be keeping them because PC is all I care about.END UPDATE---------------------ORIGINAL REVIEWThings that mattered to me in choosing these headphones...1. I'm not going to try and sugar coat this too much. I don't have money to burn. But a set of headphones that check all my boxes without doing anything I hate for a price I can handle is a tall order. Good headphones have never been cheap. ANC is still a premium feature (though this is changing fast). These headphones were just barely in my price range at $150. And frankly, although I like everything about them (so far) I think $100 would have been closer to the price these should be selling for. This segment of the market is crowded and if I was willing to gamble even more than I did, I could have probably gotten something I was happy with for significantly less than that $150. I went with Sony because I'm an old guy and I know that you usually don't pay more for a Sony product for no reason.2. Comfort. Of course, we're talking perceived comfort. Comfort involves a lot of guesswork. For these, it appears that I mostly guessed right. These just fit my ears with a little pressure here and there. My ears are not small but also not that large. If you have large ears, you should probably go somewhere where you can try the headphones on before you buy. I probably should have done this myself because comfort is always my top priority (other than price). Most likely the pads on these will not be difficult to replace should the need arise. And it usually does with headphones. Sooner or later, the pads will always wear out.3. ANC - Of course. This is my first pair of ANC headphones and it's everything I want. The transparency mode is slightly quieter than I would like but it's acceptable. I've seen some people complaining about the ANC not being effective on these. Not sure what they're talking about but maybe they're coming from much higher end ANC. For me, the first day I had them, I had some people come to see me and they were banging on my door. I heard absolutely nothing. They were freaked out because they thought something was wrong. So....my verdict on this is if you want perfect ANC, maybe shop around. I'm not here to tell you it's the best. I don't have anything to compare it to. I can only say it leaves me wanting nothing and I'm happy with it.4. Sound quality - Out of the box, I found the factory sound to be lacking. But that usually happens with me when I have new headphones. I can't say for sure if the burn in effect is psychological or real but all I can say is a new pair of headphones takes some getting used to for me. At least the EQ is sufficiently adjustable in the app and I managed to get them to sound very nice. It's nice that the settings you choose in the app will be stored in the headphones so the same settings will apply on other devices. I mostly use Bluetooth headphones on my Windows 10 PC so I'm not going to be fiddling around with the app much. These can go pretty loud and have decent bass. The drivers can provide good clarity for mids and highs if you fiddle with the EQ. The stock EQ sounds muffled. But that also might be a result of them not having been burned in. CONS - It's really nitpicking for me to find many cons. These are great headphones (at least initially).1. The buttons could be a bit more tactile. In particular, I find the play/pause button a bit difficult to find and always find myself hunting for it. It is right between the Vol +/- buttons and should stick out a little more than it does to make it obvious. Also, the ANC button is nearly flush with the earcup and still makes me hunt for it a bit more than I like. I think I'll get used to these buttons eventually but I don't love them.2. The shortest timer for the auto off that's available in the app is 15 minutes. I was really kind of surprised that there was no option for a shorter time.3. The headband is adjustable by clicks. So if the size you need is between two clicks, you might have to have them slightly too tight or slightly too loose. The higher end Sony headbands with no clicks seem like they would be better in this way.4. Although (as I said) the comfort is pretty good, it's not great. But this is not terribly unusual for lower end headphones. I strongly prefer over ear (earcups that surround the ears rather than sit on them and smash them) and I'm very picky about it. I don't like it if my ears are not completely inside the earcups and I don't think it's asking much since my ears are not enormous. I find that these do kind of smash the tops of my ears. It's not something I notice right away but after about half an hour or so, it starts to become something I'm almost constantly aware of. It's not exactly painful but it isn't really pleasant either. To make matters worse, there is a seam in the fake leather that runs all the way around the inside where your ear is probably gonna be if your ears are just slightly larger than the ears of a child. I find that many of these types of earpads have that seam and I don't know it's purpose but I know that ones that don't have it tend to be easier on your ears even if your ears don't fit perfectly. So all I'm saying is this isn't some upstart company. This is Sony. These are low end Sony headphones but they're still not really cheap and they're still made by an enormous company that's been around for many decades. I don't know what it is. Almost every company that makes headphones of this sort makes the earcups too small for even slightly larger ears. I guess they think people with larger ears don't use headphones. Of course my ears could be really large. In which case, I probably wouldn't be able to wear them even if they were a little larger.5. Also, I have to kind of agree with all the other reviews that mentioned the little plastic part that sticks out from the area where the driver is on the inside of the earcup. I am not sure if it actually pushes on my ears or not but it seems like it might. I kind of feel something and it does stick out far enough to where I can see how it could rub your ears. I think these pieces are the place where the microphones are mounted so if that's the case, they kind of have to be there but they probably don't have to be as poorly designed as they are. I feel like I might be able to trim some of the plastic off if I really wanted to but I'm not going to start working on a brand new set of $150 headphones.

RDXZTSURXCBC2,B0BS74M665,5.0 out of 5 stars These won out over every other set of headphones I tried,M.O.S.,5,"UPDATE 3/13/23: I noticed another reviewer mention that the padding has given out some after a while and I will concur that this has been my perceived experience as well. The padding flattens easily and I wish it was a bit more robust. I wouldn't say that the speakers are poking my ear, but I do feel my ear being pressed slightly and it does lead to minor discomfort over time. So I would say that the padding could definitely be better on these, and it should be at this price point. I would maybe deduct a half star for this if that was an option, but since it's not, I'm keeping my 5 star rating. I'm still happy with the sound, but I'll definitely be looking out for some better pads.Original Review:I'm impressed with these headphones. They are really good. I will, however, call out from the beginning that you lose some functionality and build quality (potentially - more on that below) seen in more expensive headphones and even though these are ""only"" $150, I think it's a bit pricey. But I think good headphones are just ridiculously expensive in general. With that out of the way, here are the headphones I tried in addition to the WH-CH720N: Sony XM4 & XM5, Sennheiser Momentum 4, Soundcore Q30 & Q45, and Technics EAH-A800.My main objective in getting new headphones was to get a serious sound quality upgrade from the Soundcore Life Q20’s that I've had for several years now, and I was finally ready to pay $300-$400 for it if I had to. I was looking for clear mids and highs with deep, clear, separate bass (think of the difference between a sound system with a separate subwoofer vs a sound system without that tries to pack the bass into the main speakers). With the caveat that sound quality is subjective to the listener, here are my thoughts on each of the headphones I tried:Technics EAH-A800 - absolute garbage and a joke at their price. These didn’t even merit more than a few minutes of listening.Soundcore Q45 - disappointingly uninspiring sound compared to the much cheaper Q30. They lack bass. I spent very little time with these because I knew that I would take the Q30’s over them without question.Soundcore Q30 - These are very good for their price (compared to the other options at that price). If I hadn't been willing to spend $300+ for the best sound, I would have kept these despite the fact that they powered off in the middle of calls (a problem I believe is specific to OnePlus phones based on my research). But compared to more expensive headphones, the Q30's bass was not as well defined/separated and it bled into all the frequencies, lending to an overall muddy sound - comparatively. But these are good, and at their price point, I doubt you can find better headphones.Momentum 4 - These headphones had, hands down, my favorite bass signature; it was fantastically clean and able to hit impressive lows I could not hear in any other cans. The overall sound was very good, although I never could get them to sound as clear as I wanted once I experienced the 720's. The M4’s have fantastic battery life. Sadly, there were quite a few issues with the M4’s. They sound awful in wired mode - like, don’t even bother, they’re that bad. Taking calls on the M4s was a very weird experience; it’s hard to explain, but voices sounded kind of echo-y, but in the sense that it was like the voice was everywhere around me to the extent that I was sure that everyone else in the room was hearing the voice just as clearly as I was. I couldn’t decide if I liked it or not - all I can say for sure is that it was a very strange experience. The M4's had software bugs that I just couldn't overlook, such as the audio being out of sync with video when using aptx (I had to use the lower SBC format to get the audio in sync and this just didn't make any sense!). The touch controls and on ear detection were a bit of a hit or miss. Software updates are unreasonably slow - like 20 minutes or longer. They are quiet - I found that I had to crank them up well past 50% to get enough volume, but at the end of the day, it didn’t really matter because they did get as loud as I ever needed and still had the ability to go louder. And they are on the heavier side, which meant they didn't stay in place on my head if I looked down or up. I actually ordered a second pair hoping that the software issues were a defect, but the replacement had all the same issues. But that bass was so good I was tempted, even prepared, to overlook all of those shortcomings. Until I tried the XM5's and the 720's.Sony XM4 - I'm sure these were great for their time, but their age is evident. The sound was muddy and uninspiring to me. I quickly moved on from these.Sony XM5 - these are good - very good. I would have kept the XM5's if the 720’s hadn’t been released just as I was comparing all of these headphones. The sound is very close to the 720's, but just not quite as clear, though I think the bass may go a bit lower than the 720's. It really mostly came down to price when deciding between the XM5 and 720. The XM5's are feature rich with an excellent ambient mode (the best I’ve experienced). ANC is good, but not at the level I expected for their reputation and really not significantly better than most other headphones. Compared to the 720’s, I’d say the ANC actually blocked out less noise, but the XM5’s made almost no static sound with ANC on and that may have played into that perception because I think the slight static noise the 720’s make might just be covering up the external noises that I’m hearing more on the XM5’s. But getting the absolute best ANC was not the most important thing for me. I liked the touch controls on the XM5’s - it's easier than feeling around for the correct button. But is it worth the price? Not for me - I'll take the trade-offs of the 720's for the savings, especially since I think the 720's sound better. But I can easily see how someone would buy the XM5’s over the 720’s if money is not an issue.Finally, Sony WH-CH720N - these really are best described as the budget version of the XM5’s. Remember how I mentioned that they sound very similar to the XM5’s? Yeah, sometimes I forgot which headphones I was wearing, they are that close (post EQ-ing them to the best sound I could get from them). The ANC and Ambient modes aren’t quite as good on the 720's, they don’t have touch controls (a positive or negative depending on the person), and they don’t feel as solidly built (though I might argue that is only because of how incredibly light they are - they actually seem well built and there are no creaks, but their lightness is easily perceived as “cheap”). The 720’s don’t come with a case and they don’t fold (but the XM5’s don’t fold, either); not a big deal to me. Not folding just means they have fewer breaking points and are less obnoxious to handle when off the noggin. These live on my desk, so a case is not important to me. For traveling, I prefer the compactness of earbuds anyway. The auto off feature only works after they lose bluetooth connection, which for the majority of us, only happens if we turn our phone off or walk far away from the headphones. So, not significant value there, though I do turn off my phone every night, so the headphones will at least shut off at night if I forget to do it manually, and that is good enough for me. The 720’s are strictly controlled with physical buttons that are well placed, though I find myself expecting the ANC/Ambient button to be on the back, not the front (don’t know why, because it actually makes sense the way they did it), causing me to push the wrong button more than I’d like. And I wish the volume up and down were more distinct from the play/pause button. The buttons are my only real (but minor) complaint, but I'm getting used to the buttons and will be fine in short order. The 720’s are slim compared to the XM5’s and the M4’s. And did I mention they are light? They are insanely light and extremely comfortable. Most importantly, the 720’s sound really good. While they don’t quite have the bass signature of the M4’s, they are so well balanced and clear across all of the frequencies (without being harsh or sibilant) while still having great, clear bass that it could be argued that the 720’s sound better. I just kept finding myself going back to the 720’s over every other set of cans. These headphones won out over the rest from my limited (but targeted) comparison. There might be better sounding headphones out there, but I haven't found them.","February 27, 2023",AGWCBQURF7TKPYVF4OTHIOZEU6DQ,True,449.0027,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.2010442720859387,Positive,0.9996,Positive
R1DAPTTG9ZZ22P,B0BS74M665,4.0 out of 5 stars Light and quality,Zoe xx,4,"These headphones are light, airy and they feel like holding a feather; however they’re not as easy to fly off in the wind. Their performance is amazing, I wish I didn’t have to download an app to really get full quality but that’s one downside. The sound quality if gravitating with the surround sound and the noise cancelation mode is great for going in crowded places, as someone who gets overwhelmed. I mowed the yard and with the NC my ears were much at ease from the loud noise. I love the build of the headphones, sleek but also angular and round at the right places. As a girl who loves to personalize things I wish there was more space on the surface of the cuffs to ass stickers but that’s just a small unneeded want. The ear cuts for ears perfectly, and they do not push down on your ears, or head; making wearing them for hours not leave slight pain like most headphones do. I love that pressing the power button once tells the user the battery power and pressing it for two seconds turns it off, it’s easy to use and does not require mass amounts of brain cells waiting to be lost. I have yet to test the durability as I just got them a day ago. On the other hand, the charging is impeccable. I received them at 60% charge and have been using them for quite some time and they are still, at 56%. Along with the NC mode the headphones also come with an ambient mode for everyday use, for people who want to hear their surroundings as a safety mechanism which is great versatility. One con I noticed soon inspection is that they don’t fold down like most headphones. Now I know they weren’t advertised like that but I still wish that was a quality. I bet there are much better quality and overall everything headphones out there but for a discounted prime day price 88$ which is cheap for headphones, (but not for my wallet) these are a steal and I give these an 8.5/10!","July 28, 2024",AGFDSBWED5A7ZVP3COSNNO54X2ZQ,True,3.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.32901945724526377,Positive,0.996,Positive
R3DUD8062XSOP6,B0BS74M665,"4.0 out of 5 stars Had a couple minor issues, but otherwise I totally love these!",Jj,4,"It arrived smelling minty fresh, which kind of threw me off initially... until I realized the alternative would probably be the scent of someone else's sweat lol! So kudos for that.It arrived with no issues and has been working very well for the last month. I'm autistic and having noise cancellation technology in my headset has been life changing for me. The way the noise cancelling in this headset works is completely tunable by the wearer. There's noise cancelling and ambient sound modes. I've included screenshots of the app you can use to fine tune it. The voice passthrough feature in itself is pretty useful, as if it's on the noise cancelling mode, hearing speech can be really hard. It's hard to explain, but with this feature turned on, if someone talks to you, it seems to briefly switch to ambient sound mode to hear speech near you. It's super fluid and will switch back within about a second of the speech ending. The only caveat with this feature, though, is that it seems to have to be rather loud (or very close) speech in order to be picked up. So if I'm holding a baby and it coos in my ear, it'll trigger the voice passthrough. But if someone is quietly talking to me a few feet away, I'll usually have to manually switch. Not a huge deal, but probably worth making a note of.I've also had one instance of garbled audio from my headset. I had to turn them off and back on to fix it. It happened suddenly on a phone call.Other than those two things, this headset has been amazing. I also want to say that the battery life is pretty amazing, as it can be used pretty heavily for at least a couple days without having to be charged. I'll be listening to audio for a few hours straight sometimes and it only drops the battery down about 10%. Also, the microphone quality is pretty good. Especially when compared to my older Bluetooth headphones that I used to use. People can actually understand me on the phone with these, which is really helpful if I need to talk to someone on the phone but don't want to hold my phone or can't. I'm so happy that I got these and also I'm happy at the fact that they were available refurbished so I didn't have to pay hundreds of dollars to have these headphones.","July 12, 2024",AH7VVTYVPLUI3AIH2LWXOMFM75BQ,True,10.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.15855555555555553,Positive,0.9963,Positive

The sound was murky and muddy, not pleasant at all.I spent a lot of time tinkering with the EQ to pull out the upper frequencies and give it a better bottom, and ultimately I have achieved a pretty nice sound from the headphones. I tested the headphones with On The Run by Pink Floyd (awesome for testing headphones) and it did prett welly . . . the stereo effects were well separated. There are moments in the song that just sizzle and I didn't quite get that edginess, but overall the sound is decent, especially for inexpensive headphones.Noise canceling works very well - I'm listening to Adele now while blissfully blocking out my wife's gothic romance TV show LOL.The headphones are very comfortable - not the decadent comfort you get with Bose headphones, but prety darn nice - and much cheaper. I took the headphones to the gym and spent a half hour on the treadmill with them - very comfortable. I don't know how durable the ear pads will be long term, but for now they're great.I'm giving this 4 stars because the unequalized sound they provide is pretty awful. If you're willing to devote the effort to equalize the sound significantly, you can get really nice sound from extremely comfortable headphones that block out external noise - at a good price.","August 18, 2024",AEV6GKBYIKW6VJLEEWRSEH5PAO5A,True,0.0,Color: WhiteStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.21939814814814815,Positive,0.9898,Positive
R2S0W039U66C9M,B0BS74M665,3.0 out of 5 stars Was impressed….Not so much anymore.,jenjaine,3,"Update 3/9……so first I’m going to say that I bought these with my own money before any reviews were out. Didn’t realize they were a vine product. After a few weeks of use the padding has relaxed enough so that I can feel the drivers poking my ears. I wear my headphones around 4 hours a day on weekdays and 8-10 hours on each weekend day. As stated earlier I have a smaller than average head, and my ears do not stick out. I can usually adjust the cups to be lower, but I don’t like them riding my jawbone.I would’ve have overlooked that because they do sound good, however they are now randomly disconnecting. I use them for YouTube and I’m literally 18 inches away and they disconnect. I check through the app and it shows a connection failure. If I pause a video, again, they show connected, but the sound comes out of my iPad. When I check the app it tells me there is a connection failure and to restart. While the sound is good I don’t think I care to restart my headphones every 10 minutes. Maybe they don’t like Apple devices? I’m not sure….I originally bought the xm5’s. I finally got them last week only to find they were quite oversized for my smaller than average head. The weight of them made matters worse as every time I looked down they flopped forward. I had to return them.I am not one of those fancy audio people but I know what I like. My previous headphone were the solo pro 3’s and I do enjoy them. What I don’t like is the pain my ears experience after about an hour of having them on.I wanted over the ear headphones and everything I read and all the videos I watched pointed me to the xm5’s which ended sadly. I searched Amazon and saw these were a new model. Looked up what little I could find online about them and the consensus was these were the cheap version of the xm5’s. Yeah, I’m sold so I got them.Build: They are cheaper feeling, not as bad as the 510’s, but nowhere near the xm5’s workmanship. But they are also not breaking the bank (as bad anyways, it still shocks me to see what headphones are going for nowadays). The sliding part is plastic reinforced by metal. I’ll be honest….I am wondering how they will hold up.Comfort:Excellent. These are super light. I don’t feel them resting on the crown of my head at all. There is no clamping on or around my ears. But the are secure on my head. The padding around the ear cups is decent and the cups are deep so most will not have their ears touching the speakers.Bells and whistles: these are old school, they have buttons…no swipe features at all. I like that because in my week of using the xm5’s I discovered quickly that volume adjustment was hit or miss with response time. It might be that my hands are always cold, but in 6 hours of wearing these I have already mastered the buttons. They are very well placed and very responsive.App: They are part of the Sony Headphone app. You get an equalizer and other customizable features including the ability to connect to two devices at the same time and it works great as I use the headphones for watching music videos on YouTube and Netflix. I use my phone to adjust the equalizer for the music playing on my iPad.Another feature on the app is you can set the headphones to shut off when not in use. I was excited about the auto shutoff feature. Not so much now. It is not sensor based nor is it based on when you device’s screen shuts down. It is based on when you turn of Bluetooth. This makes it worthless to me and maybe a lot of us who do not ever turn Bluetooth off. I think it could have been done better.Noise cancelling:I’m going to call this adequate. With my Beats Solo pro with ANC I can’t hear anything. Not even someone yelling. These will drown out the hum of a fan pretty well, but they let in a lot of ambient noise (like my husband coughing in the next room right now!). Even the xm5’s were not as good as the Beats. But the on ear style of the Beats may have something to do with that. So I’ll stick to the xm5’s comparison. I also want to say that there are supposedly 3 modes…noise cancelling, ambient and off. I have not noticed any difference between ambient and noise cancelling. There is no voice prompt to let you know which setting you are in. I will play some more to see if I’m missing a setting in the app and if something changes I’ll edit my review.Sound quality: (of course this is subjective to each person) Excellent out of the box and I could not say that about the xm5’s. My first mission was to find the equalizer when I took them out of the box and tried them. Not so with these. The sound was nice. I still tweaked it but if I wasn’t able to change it a bit, I would still be happy.Other:They do not come with a case. They do not fold. They come with an aux cord and charging cable, no charging block.Final thoughts: This is my fourth pair of headphones in a month. I was willing to drop over 300 bucks on a pair. And I didn’t like any of them. Most important to me is fit and sound. Most were severely lacking in sound quality. These are not. And they were cheaper.I am most disappointed in the build quality. I think they should’ve done better. To me $150 is alot of money to spend on headphones that feel this plasticy. And if they crack after 6 months I’ll be upset. I’m not expecting $350 quality, but better. These are not too much better than the 510’s when they should’ve been a little less than the 910’s. They are far less quality than the 910’s. Maybe I’m asking too much after coming from the Solo 3 pros and xm5’s which both have a superb build.BUT…..they make up for it in having great sound that you can totally adjust to your liking. They are comparable to the xm5’s in sound. And far superior I feel to the 910’s which just sound overly undefined bass. And the comfort!! It’s spot on.These are the best out there in terms of sound and app capabilities.","February 26, 2023",AGXDFCDZA6AFQCJUJARL5E5KIL2A,True,215.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.1678867416566885,Positive,0.9982,Positive

R29EARG1RU48IA,B0BS74M665,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad but they have one big flaw.,Sgt. Slab Wrankle,4,They are pretty decent headphones with good sound but my one big issue with them is you can't use them while they are charging. It will disconnect soon as you plug it into the charger. This is a huge issue for me because I sleep with headphones since I live by a big airport & need to sleep with noise canceling headphones. So if you're a regular headphone user who uses headphones almost 24/7 you may want to have a spare around. I'll have to use my old E7 headphones for this & rotate between the two instead of replacing my old E7 headphones with the new Sony headphones like I was hoping to be able to do. Its weird because much cheaper off-brand headphones I've tried can be used while they are charging so not sure why this went by Sony of all companies. Sound quality seems pretty decent & noise canceling seems to work for the most part & they are pretty comfortable. The manual could have been better illustrated & thought out like they could have mentioned the fact it can't be used while charging & maybe have a diagram of how to remove the ear pads & how to clean them. It's mostly allot of vague technical info with some basic instructions. Overall they seem decent but definitely feel like they are overpriced. They felt more like $100 or sub $100 headphones rather than over $150 headphones.

As we all know traveling these days can be challenging. In the past I’ve relied on earbuds/airpods, etc but there is always some excess noice on airplanes when trying to watch a movie or listen to music. These Sony headphones really cut out the excess background noise very well. Not only could I hear the movie I was watching much better but it also muffled the surrounding chatter, baby crying, etc as well. I highly recommend.","August 30, 2024",AGB6M52WFY2YJ3YB673GA7ZRGS3A,True,1.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.13099999999999998,Positive,0.7769,Positive

For some reason my head usually perceives noise cancelling technology as pressure, so in the past they have made me get headaches and even a brief case of vertigo. Also, I tend to warm up very quickly, so other the ear headphones usually make my ears warm rather quickly. I can say I did not experience either with this pair of headphones. They are very comfortable, and I can enjoy them for long period of time with no issue.","August 22, 2024",AEZ3V6J7TRRHKISXATXPIYYYRBXQ,True,0.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.04448717948717951,Positive,0.024,Positive

RCWGHJUQOGTO4,B0BS74M665,4.0 out of 5 stars Super Comfortable,DJ,4,"Aesthetics/Design: 3/5These headphones have a typical over-the-ear design, so there’s nothing groundbreaking in terms of looks. However, they do have a premium feel.Comfort: 4.6/5The comfort is outstanding, even better than the premium version! These headphones are super light and don’t press excessively on your ears. The ear cups provide ample room, and your ears won’t heat up even after long periods of wear.Sound Quality: 3.5/5The noise cancellation isn’t as effective as more premium models, but overall sound quality is great. The sound is well-balanced and can be adjusted through the EQ if needed.Versatility/Features: 3.5/5These headphones are versatile enough for a light run or gym session if you prefer over-the-ear headphones for workouts. However, they are best suited for lounging and listening to music. A standout feature is the ability to touch and hold one earphone to temporarily allow ambient sound while in noise cancellation mode. This means you can hear someone speaking to you without pausing or switching off noise cancellation—a super clever feature.OverallThese headphones offer good value for the money, especially if you’re not an audiophile and just want decent quality. If they’re on sale for $100, they’re a great deal. Their comfort is a significant advantage because high sound quality doesn’t matter much if you can only wear them for a short time.","June 30, 2024",AH4D6VYNJA72N7HMMUO3NJG6QILQ,True,49.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.3170114942528736,Positive,0.9956,Positive
R2NPRR39WVT9X3,B0BS74M665,4.0 out of 5 stars very pleased,King,4,"I mostly wanted headphones to block out my loud neighbors when they have summer yelling parties outside my window and it works pretty damn well for that. One guy is a real crooner and whooper, and at most it sounds like he's a few houses down. Even when they play loud music, it's muffled if it comes through the noise cancellation barrier. The NC even blocks out any machine drone nearby; I can't hear my fans, A/C, fridge or the pool pump. It's honestly eerie but that silence is golden.I don't know if this is due to a software update or I just haven't explored the app update enough but it seems like when you pair to two devices at once, you have to choose a device to hear using the app, you can't stream both.I prefer having physical buttons on the headphones but the pricier versions of Sony's line use touch sensitive contextual movements to adjust volume, connect etc. I like that a NC and ambient mode button in on there, so I can switch on the fly if I need to.I like the fake leather plush on the main part of the band and on the ear cups but I am not sure how long that will hold up, it seems very delicate. However it is pleasant to touch. These stay comfortable on me for about an hour. The only reason I really take them off is because my ears get hot and sweaty. These really are lightweight (part of my reason picking them over cheaper competitors).The only problem I had pairing was initial setup but that was really my bad because I use a dongle to get bluetooth on my computer and the driver wasn't properly installed. So be aware if you have a bluetooth dongle for connectivity that it has to have the proper latest driver installed or else it will just not pair.THE REASON I RATE THIS FOUR INSTEAD OF FIVEYo, person at Sony forced to read these for a living, PLEASE pass this along. THE CHARGING CABLE. Bruh. BRuH! Look I get it I appreciate shorter cables, I am not charging things in another room or something, and I like to save space when I travel with a bunch of cables. But this short cable doesn't work on any of my pc's usb ports so I have to plug it into an adapter. The adapter brick is plugged into an extension cord on the floor, which means I can't put the headphones on my shelf at the same time, it doesn't reach. So I have to put the extension cord up on the shelf or put my headphones on the floor. For someone directly charging from a wall outlet, your headphones are gonna dangle half on the floor, half in the air. Even when I get the extension cord up on my shelf for charging, there is still not enough room for the headphones to lie flat if the adapter faces up. My workaround is that I rest the headphones on a holder on my desk and I can pull that down closer to the floor when I need to charge. BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE THAT LYFE. I should be able to just plug it into my pc and be able to put it safely on top of the PC or on a nearby surface, my choice, no major distance consideration to prohibit the safe placement. I really feel yall should send this with one small cable and one long one. Because the small is useful if someone uses a laptop or has a usb hub on their desk.","November 30, 2023",AG2Q7K7NJWYKH5TYAD7FHAM2JA4A,True,15.0,Color: WhiteStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.06878621116828665,Positive,0.9864,Positive

R1R3NMUOHID3BS,B0BS74M665,4.0 out of 5 stars beats studio 3 vs sony whch720N,Aman,4,"Build quality:Hard to say one is better than the other, the 720n is meant to be a lightweight headphone so it does feel a bit plasticky and cheap but it doesnt seem flimsy at all or that it would break. The ear cushions however don't have much padding and could be better. I do love that they can lay flat though but not being able to fold the headphone in half is a serious downside for portability.The Studio 3s have a slightly better and more durable feeling construction and have better padding but are significantly heavier. Another thing too is the rubber headband cushion, I personally hate this as it snags my hair and makes it uncomfortable. The studios can fold in half and also come with a semi hardshell carrying case which is a huge bo nus for traveling and portability.Sound quality :This one is hard to compare as well I also am not an audiophile so this is from the perspective of someone who really just uses headphones for watching videos and music at the gym. They both sound okay, not great. Each one has a different sound profile to me. The 720n is more clear vs the studios having a more bass heavy punchy sound.ANC:The ANC works good on both. The beats have the standard like white noise style ANC which i did not really notice on the 720n. I will say the 720n has a better ANC in loud environments. with the beats i still feel the need to crank up the volume to drown out the outside noise with ANC on. However with the 720n it was incredible i could barely have the volume up but ANC cancels out the majority of the outside noise ( gym music and noise ) .transparency mode :neither of these works great. It does the job but if you need to have a conversation or actually hear anything the headphones will have to come off.Functionality:the buttons on the 720n are a bit hard to get used to but not a huge deal. i hate that there are only 2 modes vs the 3 on the studios but its not a huge deal. again not being able to fold takes a toll on functionality and portability. I do LOVE how light weight these are though , you can barely feel them on your head, and are extremely comfortable. The ear cushions aren't great, you do get some sound leaking in when turning your head due to the ear cushions not creating a great seal. The Bluetooth connection works great with my iphone and there is also an app to customize and add more controls but i haven't experimented with it much yet.the studio 3s have a weird very plastic feeling button as the controls for sound which definitely could have been improved for a more premium feel. They fold up, the have a case, they seem durable, so not much to complain on here. I just hate the rubber headband cushion but thats me personally. they have the apple chip for connection so no complaints there as i have an iphone.conclusion:both of these are great headphones at a similar price point. Id say if you are between the two the deciding factor would be sound, weight, function, and use. If you are looking for decent lightweight headphoens to have with good ANC and sound quality get the 720n. If you are looking for portable, bass heavy and punchy sound get the studios. Personally, I am still on the fence but I am leaning towards the studio 3s because of the portability. i know the sony wh xm4 is probably the sweet spot of everything im looking for but it is unfortunately out of my price range.","May 16, 2023",AFAGM7G3OWWYTXYELZCVKUN5OU5Q,True,119.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.16540084388185655,Positive,0.8065,Positive

RJLHDJRWSASMP,B0BS74M665,4.0 out of 5 stars Best headset I've ever owned in 2024 hands down,Bryan,4,"This is the first headset I've owned where I've actually noticed the ""noise cancellation"" feature. Other headsets have this weird pitchy noise that comes as a side effect for their implementation but this headset is the first where I can actually say I hear (or don't hear) the difference. Absolutely game changing. The other remarkable thing about this headset is how light it is. I've owned other headsets in the past and this very well challenges some lighter on-ear headsets I have. It is also surprising how well of a fit this is when being worn. One would thing it's very difficult to develop a design that would fit as well as this does but as soon as I put it on, I could hear the same kind of ambiance as if I had put ear plugs in. Truly a feat not many competitors can claim and prove. The next thing I really like is the battery life. I don't get much time with it during the week but I almost always using it during the weekend. Battery lasts for a good amount of time as expected and while this is not unique to this headset, it does deliver on that. Where I think this headset shines is in how fast it charges. It only takes about a little over an hour to fully charge this headset and I have headsets with the same battery life. Very impressive. A perhaps unimportant detail that is subjective to most can be the sounds and voice notifications that are built into the headset. Unlike others I have owned, this headset has very pleasing notification sounds and audible/understandable voice notifications. The only thing I can say I don't considerably enjoy is the depressingly short USB cable that it comes with to charge the device. I've seen this in other Sony products, so I won't say I'm surprised but I can't help but wonder how this was meant to be charged by people? I would rather have a 2-3 foot cable that I can at least connect up to a wall socket or something other than let's say a laptop directly adjacent to it. Other than that, this product is pretty phenomenal and I look forward to keeping this product as my primary headset.","January 6, 2024",AGEFZPS2SXF6LFXHVFCQGPNKPMIQ,True,2.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.10271739130434786,Positive,0.9766,Positive

R72TXMXIRAL8,B0BS74M665,"4.0 out of 5 stars I'm not a paid reviewer, I was NOT immediately blown away by the sound but later I was blown away",Luke,4,"1-4. 1st**Sound is the most important thing to me when buying headsets. I know I'm listening to mp3's which dull sound, and that's the reason why I need headphones that can keep as much quality as possible. These headsets do accomplish that BUT I was not immediately blown away by the sound as much as I was later blown away or moreso extremely satisfied. The sound out the box presented a solid sound but the volume was too low no matter how much I turned the volume up. This was the problem if I used the analog cord or bluetooth. I then went to the app to do the equalizer thing and that drastically improved the quality of sound BUT not the volume (I'll get to the noise cancellation later). I'm not going deaf and I don't want to damage my ears, but the sound was unexpectedly and unsatisfyingly low for a $129 headset. I was afraid I'd bought a well-advertised product that was a gimmick. So I went to do my internet research and I found apps that also improved or boosted the sound even more. I got what I wanted!! The headsets can increase volume A LOT more than what Sony offers, but you have to search to find an app that will do it bc the Sony app didn't succeed in making it loud enough for me at the gym. It did cancel the outside noise but the volume just didn't do it for me. I can say that now that I found an app to increase the volume I can notice a small bit of sound distortion at the upper volume range, but it's worth it. It didn't compromise the integrity of the music. AND No I don't work for any apps and I'm not trying to sell you one, just saying that's what I had to do to reach a better volume. 2nd**Noise cancellation. I never owned noise cancellation headphones before, so I don't have much to compare it to, but I can ABSOLUTELY say the noise cancellation WORKS and does a great job of cancelling all the noises I don't want to hear. 3rd** Are they worth it? Yes, especially now that the price came down from $120 to $90, but I was a little upset bc the price changed like literally one day after I bought them higher and I live outside the US now, so returning them to get that $30 back isn't really an option. 4th I wish the Equalizer options that I set using Sony's app would work when I choose to use the analog cord. Sidenote: If you are in your house or grocery store or more private places then the volume Sony gives you is perfect, BUT WHEN you are in high energy places like the airport, gym, busy streets and you sometimes want the OPTION to have your music louder then that is when these headsets failed AND I had to download an app on my phone to boost the volume.","August 23, 2023",AHTODU47RYT6DRS6S5MYP2BCNTXA,True,27.0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphone,Sony WH-CH,0.1815940656565656,Positive,0.9888,Positive
RSSUGTMRKK05B,B0BS74M665,3.0 out of 5 stars Decent headphones but wrong cost,Amazon Customer,3,"Decent but comparing these to other headphones I've owned, both a cheaper and more expensive pair, the price does not justify the product. Pros vs cons:- Quality: this is a con for me, the cheap plastic makes it lightweight but I cannot see these being durable. The Pads feel similar to the cheaper pair I've owned and possible to breakdown easily over time/use.- Sound: this is a pro for me, the sound is actually really great and will definitely be the highlight of the cost you spend on these. I mean this is the biggest reason we buy Headphones, right? The question is if the sound is really $150 worth? Ive experienced cheaper headphones with just as good of sound.- Ease of use: this is a pro for me, the connectivity seems to be seamless and Google connection is a plus.- Comfort: this is a con for me, the pads at both the ears and top make this a difficult headphone to wear for multiple hours.- Noise Cancellation: this is a con for me, and while the NC does work, it seems to be directional and compared to others I own, this doesn't work nearly as effective.- Look: This a pro for me, since these are more sleek they do give a better appeal than my bulkier headphones.Overall this is my personal experience and preference, if you decide to buy you may feel differently. In my honest opinion, the market for headphones is so vast and there are a lot better options at a more affordable cost. If cost is less of an issue, spend a bit more and go with something even better.

I was watching a show and keep hearing creaking noise. I thought it was my house creaking , it wasn't. It was the person sitting in the chair on TV. The head phones fit great and are adjustable. The ear part is soft and well padded. They fit on my ears good. The part that goes across the top of your head is padded on the underside. It fits good against my head.

R3SOM3FJLPYPLK,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Perfect antidote to noisy neighbors!,Laughing Sal,5,"I share a wall with my next door neighbor. Luckily, there is no one on the other side of me. There has never been an issue with the tenants in this unit making any kind of noise, and I have lived in my apartment since 2016. If you were in my apartment, you wouldn't even know anyone lived next door. Everything had been nice and tranquil as far as that apartment was concerned, for years. That is, until recently.Ever experienced the joys of getting unwillingly serenaded by someone's throbbing subwoofer? The thing about being subjected to a stereo with a subwoofer going, is that the music might be barely audible, but you can *feel* the bass notes physically, especially if the stereo and subwoofer are physically nearby. And that is what is happening to me, right now. There are constant bass throbbings coming through the wall, coming from the apartment that had for so long been perfectly quiet. The music itself really isn't loud enough to be a nuisance. But the low frequency pulsations of the bass certainly *are* a nuisance. Apparently, the woman who owns that apartment has turned it over to her kids for who knows how long. Her kids are in their early 20s. Their stereo is never off, so their subwoofer is never off.I tried asking them to please realize they have neighbors, and their subwoofer is bothering their neighbors, and could they *please* limit the hours when they play their stereo. They just snarled something, and slammed the door in my face. They then started playing their stereo louder- not a lot louder, but noticeably louder. I next requested that the building Super speak to them. He did. They turned their stereo off for a few moments, after he spoke with them. I then heard the sound of something heavy being hurled against our mutual wall. Then, the stereo started up again. It was playing at a slightly lower volume. But the bass was still vibrating the wall.There had been an issue, several years ago, with problem tenants right above me, who REALLY blasted their stereo with their powerful subwoofer at all hours. They were also selling drugs, and a stream of ""America's Most Wanted"" types were coming and going also at all hours. They used the back parking lot as a stolen car storage lot. Their ""guests"" started fires in the garbage cans in the lobby, after nodding out and dropping lit cigarettes into them, as they sat in the chairs out there. You don't want to know what they were doing in the laundry room. The list of their unpleasantness goes on and on. This went on for seven years.The HOA here did nothing about them. Nothing. None of the HOA members lived in this state, so all they did was collect our money, and ignore our phone calls and emails about these nuisance, and dangerous, tenants. During this time, I developed PTSD, which was diagnosed by a psychiatrist, along with anxiety disorder and chronic depression. I rarely slept, and could barely function at my jobs. Finally, after seven years, there was a change in HOA personnel. Eventually, the problem tenants were evicted. I could hardly believe how peaceful it then became here.Thinking they would have my back, I emailed the current HOA regarding the current situation with the eternally pulsating stereo. I had recently noticed some ""please be courteous to other tenants, and keep your noise down between 10pm and 8am"" hand written notices posted around the lobby and in the hallways. I don't know if they are aimed at these particular tenants, but it seems as if this building again has some residents who are inspiring complaints.The HOA told me, basically, that I was on my own. The HOA just told me to keep “negotiating” with the neighbors, who had already demonstrated they could care less if they are bothering me. I will be checking on legal representation this following week, as I am disabled, and my disability was caused in part by the constant unpleasant behavior I was subjected to by the tenants upstairs when the HOA did nothing years ago for so long, though I emailed and called them about their activities, which clearly were in violation of the HOA bylaws, over and over again. It looks like I have another situation like that on my hands again.However! I thought- what can I do that can help me right now? I typed ""sound canceling wireless headphones"" into the Amazon search bar, and found a lot of choices. Most of the results were far beyond my means, as I am on a fixed income, and it is also the end of the month. But the constant throbbing of the bass right into my physical form through my bedroom wall was starting to literally make me sick. Google the effects that constant low frequency sounds- even when these sounds are not audible- have on the human body. These kind of sound waves are not good for human health, especially in the long term. Needless to say, I felt very vindicated after reading the findings of these scientific studies.The reviews for the Soundcore Anker Life Q20 headphones were predominantly positive. The review that really encouraged me to go for it was the one mentioning the work colleagues who seemed to possess no indoor voices, and who constantly and loudly discussed basketball results et al at the top of their lungs without a care as to who they might be bothering with the volume of their voices. I could totally relate to that story. I used to work in a call center, where you made your living by being on the phone, so you needed to be heard by clients, and you needed to hear who you were talking to. This call center had an open floor plan, so we were in low-walled cubicles, but if someone stood up and shouted, even if they were on the other side of the room, you would hear them clearly from where you were. I found that I was surrounded by the kind of people who thought that yelling across the work floor to a distant friend about the softball game their kid had played the previous evening, while they were standing basically right next to me while I was on a call, was perfectly ok. These people weren’t adults. They were like giant toddlers, with no filter. Many of them were in their late forties and early fifties. When I later would ask them- politely- to be more cognizant of their volume level of their voice, as I was attempting to do my job, they became outraged. The nerve of me, to attempt to request they be considerate of their co-workers! Lol. So reading that these headphones had helped in that situation (I wish I had had them when I had been working at the call center) right then and there I thought that's it- I am ordering these headphones, and right now.And I am so glad I did! I was happily surprised, as they are not expensive headphones, at their ability to block out ambient sound. I usually run a white noise soundtrack in the background when I am home. I had turned it on automatically this morning, and started answering my emails. I hadn't realized I had boosted the volume on the white noise a bit too much, as I had put on and fired up my new Anker headphones before switching on the receiver. I took the headphones off for a moment to adjust my hair at one point, and was amazed, as the white noise was playing far too loudly- far louder than I would ever play it. Had I been using my regular J Lab wireless earbuds, I would have heard that it had been turned up too much right away. I actually dashed into my bedroom to turn down the receiver, as I felt bad for MY neighbors!As far as the subwoofer- so far, I (knock wood) haven't been able to hear it. At all. I have had the headphones and the white noise going in my bedroom, and I took a break from my work (I work from home) after lunch to read ,and hang out with the kitties. I didn't hear any boom boom boom at all. I had heard them playing the stereo earlier, when I had been wearing my regular earbuds, so I am happy to report that these Anker headphones really appear to be helping.The headphones were delivered this morning, so I can't attest as to their long-term performance, or their performance under various conditions (if they turned up their stereo up extra loud, my wearing the headphones without the white noise running, etc.) but so far, I am VERY satisfied with their performance. I was shocked at how fast they charged, and I have been wearing them for hours, yet they are still showing a full charge. They are comfortable to wear. I have a regular sized head, and I am picky about over the ear headphones. A lot of them give me a headache: these, so far, have not. They are nice and snug, so they keep the ambient noise out, but are not excessively tight. I actually fell asleep during my after lunch break hanging out with the cats, which is unusual for me to do with over the ear headphones.Cons: the instructions for the controls for the headphones are rendered in a “cartoon” style, so that was a bit odd, but not too difficult to figure out. The max volume is pretty good, and I like my headphones to get loud. I don't usually listen to music on headphones. There is a ""bass boost"" feature (a hard to understand voice sort of croaks ""bass up"" when you push the button with the triangle on it between the up/down volume buttons, and ""normal""- I think that's what it says- when you turn the extra bass off) but this feature doesn't seen to make a huge difference. It does make voices sound richer and fuller. --Ok- I just tested the headphones with music. I chose to play ""Wardance"" by Killing Joke, as I know that song well, and yes, the ""bass up"" feature does make a noticeable difference. But as far as music goes- these headphones, for an old punk like me, would need to get a LOT louder, when playing music, for my taste. But that is a subjective thing, and I really didn't buy them to play music, but to listen to podcasts and to watch movies and YouTube stuff, and of course to block out that *&^%$!! subwoofer.I've only had one phone call while wearing the headphones. I wasn't crazy about how the other person sounded- they sounded kind of ""tinny,"" and distant- but according to them, they could hear me clearly. So I guess they work fine there, too. —EDIT: I have taken other phone calls with these headphones on after that one initial call. The voice on the the other end at the beginning of the call was a bit crackly, but this happens often with my carrier. After a few moments on the call, I could hear the caller perfectly. I make and receive calls with these Anker headphones all the time now. I always begin the call by saying “I’m wearing a new headset- I just want to make sure- can you hear me ok?” I am always assured that I can be heard just fine. A friend of mine, who is used to my cheaper earbuds on our calls, has told me repeatedly that my voice sounds much clearer on our calls with these headphones.PROS: these headphones are the fastest charging electrical anything I have ever owned- period. It's actually kind of freaky how fast these things charge. It's great. They also hold a charge the longest amount of time of any electrical thing I've ever owned. I wore them all night to block out the thump thump of the subwoofer and, after six or seven hours of sleeping, I checked their charge level on my iPhone. Their battery level was still showing as a solid green circle meaning- they were still at, or nearly at, 100% charge. That's impressive.One of the reviews mentioned these headphones don't come with an ON/OFF switch. They do. Left and Right headphone ear cup side orientations are marked inside the ear cups with an ""L"" and an ""R."" The power switch is on the Left side cup, right above the ""NC"" (noise canceling) switch, which I always leave switched on. Volume Up and Down, and the triangle-marked button, the Bass up or down switch, are located on the Right side cup.Their Noise Canceling capability is VERY impressive, given their low price point. There are times when I can *just barely* hear the bass from next door. But really- it's negligible, compared to what it was. I'm also going to take some other steps to help deal with this situation, but until then, these headphones have given me back the ability to have some nice, unbroken sleep, which is worth its weight in gold.I will update my review if something drastically changes regarding the performance these headphones. But right now- I am really happy I ordered these. I placed my order around midnight, and Amazon got them to me at around noon the next day. I'm really glad of this, as not having to endure that subwoofer- let's just say these headphones arrived just in time to save my last nerve.I am happy with the purchase of these headphones, and highly recommend them. Thank you.","July 29, 2024",AHZBX4Q7Z34G5A7WOM25AIKG47CQ,True,101.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.1000435626102293,Positive,0.9996,Positive
R147FO991T3TBD,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones at a great price!,PeterBillie,5,"These are awesome headphones! I bought them after two poor and frustrating experiences with expensive earbuds from Jabra and JBL - they would stop working at after a year. So I decided to purchase something less expensive (and separately decided to move on from earbuds) in the event I needed to buy again next year! And I am so glad I did. They are comfortable. The sound is great. Call quality is good. The buttons are easy to use. No app to download; they connect to Bluetooth easily. The battery last a long time - I listen to podcasts on long walks most days a week, and I rarely need to charge them. The noise cancelling isn't 100%, but is pretty damn good - enough to drown out distractions when I need to focus. I wish I had found these earlier and didn't waste my money on those earbuds! I've only had them about 6 weeks, so I don't know how long they'll last, but they don't feel cheap and they have already been worth the investment.","August 6, 2024",AGHL2SHHNWR3X7RM4JWWCAT5YLRQ,True,34.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.16379310344827588,Positive,0.9261,Positive
RMO3BYL4R5F6X,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Good budget headphones,Justin,4,"I bought these because I wanted a cheap (inexpensive) set of headphones for the gym to replace my AirPods Pro. I was getting tired of fiddling around with the silicone wing attachments for the AirPods.The quality of these Q20’s seems pretty decent and they are comfortable, though I haven’t worn them for an extended period of time.The sound quality isn’t as great as what you would expect from a more expensive set of headphones, but that was to be expected and they sound pretty good for the price.Noise cancellation in general is pretty weird to me, so I’m not sure how good or bad it is in these Q20’s when it works, but I wasn’t impressed. When I tested it sitting in my room, it did a decent job at drowning out the ambient noise like the hum of my fan, etc. I did notice that ANC does reduce the volume a bit.However, at the gym I felt like the ANC was struggling to work properly. While I was on the stationary bike, it kept alternating between drowning out the ambient noise and letting it through. It sounded as if I was lifting one of the ear cups and then setting it back over my ear repeatedly. Didn’t notice it too much after that, but not sure if I just got used to it.The bass boost feature does add a little more thump to your music but sacrifices audio clarity, so I definitely wouldn’t use it.Overall, these are a decent pair of headphones for $40, audio quality is good, ANC is alright, and they are comfortable.","May 27, 2024",AHJQELHY4ARFZHT5HDCBSP3UVGQQ,True,41.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.16757812500000002,Positive,0.9919,Positive
RHOPBCTZD9LDU,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Unbeatable Price:Performance!,Joel,5,"I've had the Soundcore Q20 headphones for almost a month now, and I thought I'd start off my review with one simple statement: I've only charged these things ONCE since I've taken them out of the box. These headphones have absolutely phenomenal battery life. The only reason I charged them was because I wanted to test how long they would last on a full charge (within my day to day use). I received these headphones on the 1st of April. It is currently the 27th of April and the battery is still at ""Medium"" (there is no visual indicator, however there is a voice that tells you whether your battery is ""High"", ""Medium"", or ""Low"").That being said, I'll go ahead and list some Pros:- Battery Life (Seriously, I can't stress enough how good it is)- Sound Quality- Comfort- Looks- Sturdiness/Build Quality- Noise Cancellation (there's a caveat here, continue reading to see what I mean)BATTERY LIFE:As if I haven't already said enough, these headphones refuse to die. I've used them from anywhere between an hour to 3-4 hours at a time (long gaming sessions or binging a show on my laptop or phone), and they just don't let up. Like I mentioned in the intro, it's been almost an entire month with these headphones and I've only had to charge them once. It is worth mentioning that the battery will drain much faster with noise-cancelling turned on, as it is indeed ACTIVE noise-cancelling and uses more power. I've got to give props to Anker for marketing these as lasting 40 hours, as this runtime is more accurate when noise-cancelling is ON. With ANC off, these can easily last 60+ hours. It's always refreshing to see a company slightly under-sell and over-deliver.SOUND QUALITY:These things sound way better than they should at this price-point. I wouldn't call myself an audiophile, but I do have experience with over-ear, closed-back studio headphones (I own a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's), and dabble in amateur sound mixing/mastering as a guitarist. Apart from being just a bit heavier on the bass than I would like, these headphones do an excellent job at bringing out lows, mids, and highs in pretty much anything you'll find yourself listening to. Nothing sounds drowned out or overexposed (with the exception of the bass, but there's a valid reason for it in this case). I bought these headphones primarily for multimedia consumption (movies, video games, music, etc.). They have just the right amount of punch in the low-end to make things such as explosions or bass-heavy sound effects really shine. In this instance, the heavier low-end makes sense. Voices sound crystal clear, as the mids don't get drowned out by the lows or highs like on some other higher-priced headphones (looking at you, Beats..). The highs are where these things truly shine, in my opinion. Lots of budget headphones tend to sound very ""tinny"" with harsh, sharp highs to over-compensate for the overly-saturated bass, but these do a great job at keeping both the mids and highs prominent enough (despite the thicker bass).COMFORT:I've owned and used plenty of both over-ear and on-ear headphones over the years, and I can't beat around the bush here: these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. I was expecting to have to ""break them in"", given what some of the other reviews were saying, but the minute I put these on I was pleasantly surprised at just how soft and light these felt (without feeling cheap or flimsy). And I wear glasses!LOOKS:Not a whole lot to say about how these look. I wouldn't say you'll be turning heads while wearing these out and about, but for the amount of money that they cost.. I'm just saying they could've looked a lot worse. I've seen headphones three times the price that are a complete eye-sore. The Q20s are clean and minimalistic, without giving away its low price.STURDINESS/BUILD QUALITY:Although I'm not one to man-handle my devices (no matter how little they may cost), I have to say that these don't feel the least bit flimsy. I did a mild stress-test by stretching both ear cups apart as far as I was comfortable with and was able to get about 10 inches wide. I don't think anyone has a head that wide, but if you do, these are definitely going to fit. The build quality feels great, and I feel like these will definitely last a while (and I will be updating this review if that changes lol).NOISE CANCELLATION:These headphones do indeed have active noise cancelling, BUT.. I literally almost NEVER use it. Here's why: they don't need it. The headphones are built in such a way that even with the ANC off, they drown out a ton of outside noise. Unfortunately, there is a significant drop in volume when noise-cancelling is activated. The bass takes a hit as well, making it more evened out with the mids and highs (which might be a plus for some).FINAL THOUGHTS:There's only really one ""Con"" that I wasn't going to mention, and that's the carrying bag that comes with the Q20s. There's nothing really wrong with it, but I did just want to note that they used to come with a hard carrying case (according to some older YouTube reviews), and I'm a little salty that us newer buyers don't get that lol. All in all, for the $60 that I paid for these headphones, I can't think of any reason not to fully recommend them. They sound great, the battery life lasts incredibly long (almost to a suspicious degree, making you feel like today is finally the day it'll need a charge only to be proven wrong), it's got decent looks, solid build, and they even threw in Active Noise Cancellation for situations that call for some extra silence. If you're in the market for some new headphones for multimedia consumption (I definitely would not use these for any professional work, as they are not made for that), and have a bit of a stiffer budget, look no further. These will do more than its price tag leads on.","April 27, 2023",AG2IY3MWQWDS3BEK37557MIKDP2Q,True,449.0027,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.1368067689885872,Positive,0.9974,Positive
R2D5N7MVCP2FAP,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Loud office? BUY THESE!,Katy Jordan,5,"Recently, a group of half a dozen younger, rather talkative, gentlemen were promoted to my department. I'm okay with chitchat at a nice reasonable level. But as the NBA Finals approached, their enthusiasm for daily conversations seemed to grow. I overheard rave reviews of various comedy and action films and television shows. I've listened to them flirt shamelessly with the one younger girl at their desk clump. I also overheard a particularly vivacious discussion about chewing gum that lasted approximately half an hour. It felt something akin to working in a locker room slash Dutch Bros. parking lot slash mall food court. Their volume grew. And grew. And I was afraid that one day I might be inclined to staple something to one of their heads if I heard one more thing about what the Mavericks can do to get more rebounds in the next game. My current earbuds were not working - I had to keep raising the volume, prolonged wearing made my ears itchy, and somehow I could still hear the boys! Desperate, I saw these headphones for a reasonable price and thought I'd take the chance.As soon as they were over my ears, it was like I'd stepped into an oasis. I could finally hear my own thoughts. Instant focus. I have become much more pleasant to be around. I no longer feel compelled to staple things to my coworkers heads. In fact, now I find these boys quite endearing and I hope all of their sports teams win.The noise cancelling is not perfect, but for the price it is amazing. I also have loop earplugs for concerts - if that helps as a reference point, these headphones cancel more noise than that. I don't have to turn the volume of my music up as high. They really are quite pleasant - that's the best word I can think of to describe them. They're adjustable, so they fit my head perfect, and perfectly cover my ears. I've heard other people say that other headphones start to feel heavy after a while and strain their necks - I have not felt that with these at all. They are comfortable, they look sleek, the battery seems to last forever, and I HIGHLY recommend them.","June 8, 2024",AH73MYPRDV2TK2KOUSR4BVVTMNCA,True,126.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.19000000000000003,Positive,0.9921,Positive
R1R05H92ZXS4HT,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars The battery life isn't a lie y'all,Louie and Vince,5,"I have been sorely disappointed by a lot of electronics in my 33 years on this crazy planet we call Earth, but not these. They actually have an insanely long battery life. I used them for 10 hours last night no charge in-between and am using them again now switching from my phone to my PC (super easy and great connectivity, too) and they're still at 100%. I've used 'em for 3 days straight as I just expressed, like.. 15-18 hours of usage and they only dropped to around 60% charge. Again, no charging, just vibes. The sound quality and noise canceling is also really superb. I have noise sensitivity issues and get easily overstimulated by surrounding sounds, these headphones I'd say block out about 80% of the ambient fan and AC noises that drove me insane. That's why I use them for sleep as I live in a noisy household. They're a bit bulky and I have to wrap a blanket around the headphone to cushion it from smooshing on my head (side sleeper) but overall comfortable enough to sleep in. I love these things, genuinely. Was not paid to write this LMAO I have just never had such a good and reliable pair of headphones and I've used 'em since Feb daily so I feel confident to vet them.","August 2, 2024",AH2CIOWA22E6BNBVJPVALJNXQWQQ,True,1.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.17745454545454545,Positive,0.9857,Positive
R350RH0BWMBO33,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Want ANC Headphones with $$$ sound but under $60? These deliver that & more IMHO UPDATE Dec 2023,Carolina,5,"Update Dec 2023- These headphones are still as awesome as the day I received them in 2019! Ankar is truly hard to beat. Just in case you’re looking for a pair I can vouch for the quality of these.I’ve had these headphones since end of December 2019, gotten for flight over the holidays. Tried out both Bose noice Cancelling headphones at local brick & mortar store, but the price caused me to pause. On to Amazon where I found these, better price, would arrive before my flight, sounded like a deal worth a shot after reading everything about them what did I have to lose with Amazon’s return policy & Anker’s reputation for quality.I’ve had great chargers, other electronic items by Anker with great results. They arrived on time well packaged, impressive from the start, but sound quality sealed the deal.Back to Anker headphones, I love them! The sound quality is amazing, when I have ANC on I can’t hear anything but music, the outside noise is indeed cancelled. Even on my really bad flight (another story) a guy wanted to test them against his B newest headphones, so we switched for a test. He said he wish he had known about Ankers quality & price, they were impressive not that he would give up the B set, but would definitely buy them as a spare or an extra pair to use for other activities, he couldn’t believe the price. He went straight to Amazon asked me if the pair he chose were the same as mine, they were & he ordered them. That kind of confirmed I have a great pair of anc headphones & didn’t pay $$$ for them,They pair easily and are comfortable - until I’ve worn for hours then my shades/glasses are indented in my skull, time for a break, but that’s after hours of wearing-enjoying great sounding music 4-6 hrs & battery is still strong, time fly by.There are only 2 minor suggestions for Anker regarding these headphones 1) add to Soundcore app please (after thought I don’t know if it’s needed unless to customize equalizer) the volume can be controlled on the headphones. 2) the headband could use a slight redesign. Wearing them while working out, doing lawn work or inside cleaning, cooking, always moving about (excellent BT range btw), the top of headband pulls my hair as the headband is adjustable it tends to slide a wee bit & my hair gets pulled so I have to adjust them & keep going, I’ve no idea how they could do this it’s something I noticed when trying out my son's. He bought a cheap pair of JBL headphones for lawn mowing, they do fit a little better but don’t compare to Ankers sound quality, imho Would love JBL type fit on Anker Life Q20 hybrid ANC headphones!Taking phone calls while wearing headphones works great, I asked how did I sound, fine he said, then we laughed when I told him I was listening to music on my Ankers when he called & I took the call while wearing my headphones. Neither of us had any problems with quality of call. Volume is easy to find & adjust the multifunction button is easy to use for music or calls.They come with the charging cable, though I wish more companies included the wall plug in,I don’t always have a spare just ling around, ok so I never have a spare just laying about. Also the aux cable is included though I haven’t used that feature yet. A drawstring pouch to put them in, which was good as I didn’t have a case to put them in for my flight & no time to get one. Instructions are well written Anker products are always first classLove these headphones, the ANC & overall sound quality at this price point is a gift that keeps on giving. The quality of this model looks & sounds like the much higher price headphones, maybe better than some. I wouldn’t hesitate to buy for a gift as they come gift wrap ready or a gift of music for me.Overall Ankers entry into the headphone, earbud market is welcomed. I wouldn’t hesitate to try them out if you’re looking for headphones with ANC Fantastic sound, that doesn’t break the budget to tears, give them a listen I think you’re going to love them.Simply put my Anker Life Q20 ANC headphones are fantastic in quality and sound. I’m not an audiophile but I can’t find a thing disappointing in these, not quality or sound. I like a variety of music & I hear good bass, mid tones & treble, vocal it’s all there. As said for everything including quality these headphones deliver at a price that doesn’t break the bank & with Ankers outstanding customer service is amazing. I can honestly say Anker SoundCore is definitely impressive, just as their charging cables, & other electronic devices that was my first introduction to Anker products. I’m sure I’ll look at their Bluetooth speakers soon.Sorry for overly long review, there’s so many outstanding elements that I feel are important for customers to know when spending your money,I try to offer as much info I’ve experienced as possible, I’ve relied on Amazon customer reviews when making a purchase, they’re brutally honest good or bad & I appreciate that.I’ve had & used these headphones since late 22nd December, tonight is 25 July enough time to really evaluate them, they’ve exceeded my expectations, I would definitely recommend, most of all I would buy them again.Thanks if you did read this long review, good intentions to help others as they shop. UPDATE 12 August a friend of mine used my Ankers while visiting. He called back he had received his very own Anker Life Q 20 headphones. That says a lot about the sound & quality whilst respecting the customers wallet, he was so happy with his new headphones & that I recommended Ankers.Thanks again to Amazon shoppers, Amazon & AnkerUPDATE: if you’ve read my review you know I’ve had this set of headphones since Dec 2019 it’s Nov 29 2023. I thought I would need to replace them this week but not so fast! Removed them from the pouch they came with, paired with new iPhone and wore them while preparing dinner continuing until bedtime always after midnight. The quality of sound, the hours of comfort while carrying on with everything needed to be done, the joy of listening to many genres of music was fantastic even taking a call.In 2019 I think there was 1 color choice, sure I’d loved to have had the choices Anker has today but I didn’t buy them as a fashion statement but for the Anker quality, outstanding customer service in every product they put the Anker name on. These headphones have not diminished in sound quality whether I’m jamming as I go through daily chores, or taking or making phone calls while wearing this same pair of headphones.In this current economic environment I’m thrilled for Anker’s dedication to quality while delivering headphones that are affordable. And providing a fantastic choiceI wanted Amazon shoppers to know they have a choice if shopping for headphones that doesn’t sacrifice sound or quality or lasting performance. When I’m looking for another set of headphones or the Anker Liberty Air EarPods or the many chargers I’ve bought, I always look for Anker/Soundcore first I know the quality and their outstanding customer supportThanks everyone Happy Shopping","July 26, 2020",AFSQEHFGI4GKAV6ZLXDEBCO5FQPQ,True,449.0027,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.3534777259777258,Positive,0.9998,Positive
R3V6S1FQYWLWPU,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars An Honest, Unbiased Review **UPDATED**",Marc,4,"UPDATE, 2/29/20: Anker Customer Service has provided me an updated pair of the headphones for reevaluation. I have not experienced the popping issue at all with the new pair, so I am updating my rating to 4 stars. I still really enjoy the sound from these while ANC is on; strong, fun bass, and not at the expense of the mids and treble. Also, customer service also sent me replacement earpads in the event that they fail over time.Once again, I cannot say enough about how amazing Anker's customer service is. Many companies out there could learn a lot from how much they want their customers to be satisfied!UPDATE, 1/31/20: Unfortunately these are being returned, for 2 reasons:1) I'm getting the popping noise whenever I take off the headphones while playing in ANC mode (which is always). This simply cannot happen for headphones at any price point, much less $60.2) I can see already that the earpad leatherette covering is beginning to pull away from the housing. Since receiving the headphones, I have treated them with kid gloves, so in less than 2 weeks time I'm already beginning to see potential for long term build quality issues.So, as with other reviewers, bummed that these just don't live up to Anker quality. Leaving them at 2 stars as they are serviceable, but not a long term gamble I'm willing to take.ORIGINAL REVIEW, 1/25/20:We live in a world of excess. Headphones are a prime example of this. Not only are there many ""name brand"" manufacturers of headphones out there (Sony, Bose, Beats. et. al.), there are now endless ""no-name"" brands peddling junk. There are a handful of companies trying to find some middle ground, TaoTronics, Mpow, and, of course, Anker Soundcore. When it comes to headphones, at least for me, is value for price paid. Without a doubt, the more expensive headphones by Sony & Bose offer the best quality across the board, but they're not such a great value, at least for my needs. And to go super cheap with no name brands is a waste of time, as you'll make major sacrifices. Anker is trying to establish itself as the sweet spot for solid value without making too many sacrifices.Like other reviewers, I have used other Anker products, some good, some not so good. Their charging products are nothing short of spectacular. Their audio products, on the other hand, have always been hit or miss. I decided to take a chance on the Q20 headphones because A) they are a few generations in, so hopefully Anker has made improvements over time, and; B) they sit at a great price point (between $40-60 depending on timing). Not cheap, but not astronomical either.So after using them for a week, and making the decision not to return them (I have returned countless headphones), I wanted to share my first impressions. Maybe these will change over time as the build quality ages, or sound quality evolves with burn-in, but I wanted to try and help those on the fence with some honesty rather than the endless one line five star reviews.PROSComfort. While these are in no way portable, they are fairly light and not overly bulky. Most of the cheaper over-ears are simply too much like earmuffs in an attempt to maximize comfort and/or improve sound quality.Sound Quality. This one is both a pro and a con, so I will come back to this below. For the most part, I enjoy the sound quality on these. Admittedly, I like extra oomph in the bass, and these are definitely bass headphones.Battery Life. Gave them a full charge when I received them, and probably won't need to charge them again for likely...weeks. Since I only use them at work and occasionally around the house, I expect the battery to last quite a while.Value. So far, I feel like I am getting every cent out of my investment in these. Sure, they are not perfect (as you will see below), but for the price paid, they are meeting my expectations.CONSNoise Canceling. Yeah, Anker threw in noise canceling as that feature is hot right now. It's there, but it's mediocre. Would I trust it if I was a frequent traveler? No. That would be worth an investment in Bose or Sony. But at work and around the house, it's fine. I haven't encountered the popping issues other reviewers have experienced, so I will have to wait and see on that.Build Quality. This is where Anker was able to keep the price point low. These aren't the most solidly built, but they are passable so long as they are handled decently. A case would have mitigated this, but again, cost. The buttons are not the best, and over time I can tell that these will likely be the first things to fail.Sound Quality. Here is where I will contradict myself. There is a discernible difference in the bass level between noise canceling being off vs. on. When off, the cans really thump with bass, which is great when listening to pop, hip hop, or EDM. It's too overpowering for most rock songs, as it drowns out pretty much everything else. It's still listenable, but gets exhausting after awhile. With noise canceling on, it's better, but it seems like the sound quality degrades somewhat with the added layer of processing. Not a steep decline, but it does mean that I leave the noise cancellation on all the time, which will result in the battery dying quicker. Not a deal breaker.TL;DR: So overall, I recommend these headphones if you are looking for a solid pair of cans at a reasonable price, KNOWING WHAT YOU ARE BUYING. These are not going to give you superior performance on any feature, except for battery life. They are definitely acceptable for what you're paying for, and so long as the build quality holds up, should meet your needs for a couple of years. And if not, Anker has an 18-month warranty on defects, and their customer service is A+.","January 25, 2020",AFWC3HQORHDCFQJN4P76FBRXOI7A,True,69.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.15334696168029496,Positive,0.9983,Positive
R1REYVNBG5AVBE,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars There are no better BT headphones under $100,Carl Payne,5,"UPDATE: Added the 5th star. Read the review with edits at the end.Wow. I am rarely this blown away by consumer-grade peripherals, but I feel very compelled to write a glowing review of these headphones.I do a lot of audio work, and cans are ubiquitous. I have some wired Sennies that I love behind the mixer, a couple wired Audio Technicas that have stood the test of time in the broadcast studio, and a pair of nice Sony BT cans with ANC, so I will be comparing these Ankers to the Sony model WH-1000MX3.Without question, Anker has come further, faster, than a lot of peripheral manufacturers. The attention to detail in their products is exceptional, and downright attractive. The build quality is great, the packaging is great, the functionality is great, the ergonomics are great. My experience with their hubs is what leaned me toward their headphones.After a bad experience with in-ear phones on an airplane, I decided I really needed some over-the-ear headphones for flying, but I didn't want to carry around a $300 pair of cans that I only use a couple dozen times a year. I looked on Amazon, saw the reviews, read the single-star complaints, and plunked down a whopping $60 (SIXTY BUCKS?!?! Are you kidding?) figuring they couldn't sound that awful and would be perfect for the task.Let me assure you: these are the perfect headphones for flying.I like the idea that if they get lost or stolen, they're easily replaceable. I love how well they fit (with a caveat, below), and they look great. MOST of all, holy cow do they sound great!Pairing the first time was a little bit of a process, but that's to be expected the first time you play with a new toy. After that, I put on my go-to sound check song (""Sacrilege,"" by Mentallo and the Fixer), cranked the volume way up, and listened.I have no idea what the THD or frequency range on these are, but I don't think I care. The ""silent note"" at the 1:00 mark of that song came through so clearly, without even the slightest hiss or noise, that I was madly in love with them immediately. The dynamic range is exceptional, there was no need for me to play with the super-duper-bass-button-doodad, I just let it play.The highs are crisp without tinny tones, the lows are deep without rattling the 40mm drivers (I'd love a set like this with 50mm drivers), just a very clean, direct, simple, uncomplicated sound quality that rivals the AT 500's I have and is absolutely on-par with the Sonys.So I tested the ANR. I turned on the A/C in my office, reset Sacrilege, and played the beginning again. The A/C, as expected, kinda dampened the experience, but not any worse than the Sonys. I reset the song again, with the A/C on, and activated ANR (it's called ANC on the Sonys). THIS is where the two headphones differ dramatically.With Noise Cancellation on, the Ankers outperform the Sonys. Period. It's a night and day difference, so if this is why you're considering these headphones, waste no more time and go get yourself a pair.In terms of tonal quality, I put these at the top of the list of any wireless earphones anywhere. I mean it. They're better than ANY earbud type I've listened with, they're better than every other OTE without ANR/ANC, and they're as good as the Sonys, but with better ANR. They're better than any WIRED earbud, too, including the Sony IEMs I used to use back when everything had an 1/8"" jack.Sound is, as you would expect, not 'quite' as good as the higher-end wired ATs and Sennies. I don't think Anker would mind me saying that, because they're a completely different application. If you play MP3s and don't think they sound worse than lossless files, you wouldn't appreciate the higher-end phones, so go buy these right away. If you can't hear compression noise in your satellite radio, then you won't appreciate the compression of BlueTooth and you should go buy these right away.That's quite a lot of good stuff to say about a pair of headphones that cost less than a decent dinner.There are 3 reasons for the 4 star review.1. The ear pads are uncomfortable for my ears. Not VERY uncomfortable, but enough that I have to adjust the phones several times during a 3 hour flight. It might be that they're new and I just need to break them in. If that turns out to be true, I'll adjust the review up a star.2. The battery life isn't that great. To be fair, I only need about 12 hours of battery life and I'll just recharge them. However, the advertised battery life is estimated at 40 hours with ANR and 60 hours without. My experience is that with ANR I get about 22-24 hours, and without I get about 48. Now, I have not had these very long, so I've only timed my first recharges, so if it turns out the battery life goes up with proper use, I'll add the 5th star.3. They don't fold up as small as the Sonys or even my ATs. This one alone is not worth docking a whole star, but it's the only other complaint I have. Carry-on space is so limited, and there's a pocket in my bag that the Sonys fit in, and these don't (not by much though).Hope that helps you make a decision. I'm very happy with these, and I just might give them some airtime at sea level just for giggles.UPDATE January 2023: After using these headphones for a reasonable amount of time, I'm adding the 5th star. The earphone cushions did ""break in,"" which I'm not crazy about (if it breaks in, it will break out), but they did become more comfortable. Ordinary movement is sufficient to avoid the urge to move the head phones. On a 3 hour flight, they're perfectly fine. When they are new, the cushions are a bit stiff and I should have realized that, because my AT's needed their cushions replaced after umpteen years.Battery-wise, I am getting pretty close to advertised spec, but I have noticed that if you crank up the volume on your phone or player, then crank up the volume on the headphones, the battery life suffers dramatically. Play with it a bit, adjusting device volume and then headphone volume until you get good sound without noise.Finally, I'll tell you that I like these so much that I bought a BT card for my PC. These are pretty good for videoconferences, and they're nice to have while you run a buzzsaw or have screaming children next door and you just want to not be distracted. I'll still prefer my Sennies for mixing, and I still prefer my AT's for ordinary focused PC work, but these cans are exceptionally good. I cannot get over how good they are, affordable or not.Five stars. When they wear out, or break, or otherwise stop making me smile, I'll just go buy another set.","September 2, 2022",AGD5QTRAY6ASQKN7OMV3PC6POPSQ,True,449.0027,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.22639039284128562,Positive,0.9995,Positive
R3M8ANV3XTK91B,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Exceeded Expectations,Scott Logan,5,"I ordered this product very skeptically, but given the price I thought I'd roll the dice. I've had bose and seinhessers and have worked as a professional audio engineer so I knew I'd be picky about sound. These really exceeded all expectations, especially given the price.*Audio Quality*Audio quality is really great. It is not as good as some higher end brands but definitely good for everyday listening. Compared to the Bose Quietcomfort I'd say these are a 70% as good in terms of audio quality. Compared to anything in this price point it's blows it away.One kind of issue is that the audio quality changes DRAMATICALLY depending on which noise cancelling setting you're on. It seems to sound best with noise cancelling on. In transparency mode it gets tinny and thin. With noise cancelling off the bass becomes almost overwhelming. Depending on your listening style you may like one over te others but it definitely changes.*Noise Cancelling*I keep thinking the noise cancelling doesn't work that well...but my co-worker that has to basically walk in front of me before I know he's there disagrees. I'd say it's very on par with apple air pod pros- definitely not on the same level as the bose quiet comfort - but I'm very happy with it and given the passive noise reduction from the pads it works well for busy office environments or airplanes.*Comfort*You can easily listen to these all day with no discomfort. The pads are thick and soft and the tension on them isn't too much. There's a top pad that also ensure it's doesn't rub on the top of your head.*Battery Life*This is where this headset destroys ANYTHING else out on the market. I listened to these for a few days at work - probably a few hours each day - then checked the battery - it was still at 90%.*other stuff*A slight dig is the control aren't clear. For instance turning on / off the noise cancelling isn't clear which mode you're in. You have to kind of guess. There are different chimes for each but that isn't outlined anywhere. Also some controls requires long presses on buttons used for other things. All in all it hasn't affected my enjoyment of the headphones but something that I think if they thought through makes these every bit as good as headphones that are 6x more expensive.Also, I'd suggest grabbing a hard case. They come with a softcase but if you plan to travel - hardcases are great. I got this one for $10 fhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00V9EGM2G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1Overall, I've loved these and would recommend them to anyone. I might still reach for my bose in some instances where I really want that high end audio sound or my airpods when I want a smaller footprint but I'll reach for these far more often.","September 4, 2024",AHABDGAE3JC7RMHUVATQ6G6BIBTA,True,0.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.23019999999999996,Positive,0.9726,Positive
R26PK57V0AM8ZP,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Just. So. Good.,JayCie,5,"I wanted to wait a little bit, to use these on a regular basis and try out the options. So I'll just list what I like and don't like.1. I've had earlier versions of this headset and this one is the best by far. It feels sturdier and if I drop them, they don't break like other sets I've had.2. They fit comfort over my ears, and since I hate in ear or on ear headphones, these are really comfy to wear for a long time.3. The blue color 💙 is really pretty and true to the picture.4. The noise cancelation is excellent. The ambient noise has to be jet engine loud to get through while no music is playing. But once your start music that outside noise is lost behind the music. I actually got a little vertigo one day doing cardio cause I felt like I was in a weird sound proof bubble.5. The sound is nicely balanced, you can up the bass without getting scratchy and it's really clear. I can hear background sounds nicely.What I didn't like1. The app. It's not really helpful.2. I wish there was a bass boost option button so you could turn extra bass on and off.3. The older model used to tell you it was on and what the battery level was, that would be better to have than the little chime sounds.4. This is a nitpicking point, but I really wish your could get a hard shell case with it. I bought one this time but it would have been a bonus to have one.5. I really want other colors, like brown, or earth tones, or olive, or deep red. I'm getting another set, and it would be cool to have a nice color.I recommend not getting a cheaper pair to save money, spend a little more and get these cause you won't be disappointed. Get a hard shell case to keep them in and wipe the ear pads when you're done to keep them clean abs from cracking. I'm comfortable using these anywhere, even at home in place of my Bose set.","August 26, 2024",AFQLZNXGH4ZWBJHC72X7MC4XESOA,True,1.0,Color: Blue,Soundcore Anker,0.07717391304347827,Positive,0.9944,Positive
R325WZ955J5MAO,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Super-Solid Bang-For-Your-Buck Pair of Headphones!,Jordan Pon,4,"Let me start off by explaining my use-case for these headphones.I was in the market looking for something to be a good accompaniment to my brand new Oculus Quest 2. I planned on sharing the play experience with some friends, so earbuds were out of the question for sanitary reasons. I wasn't looking for stupidly-expensive headphones to have to play some VR games, but wanted something decent so Beat Saber would sound better haha. Previously, I had bought these $15 Panasonic headphones that had banger reviews, but once they arrived, I put them on, turned on some music, and instantly boxed it back up. Trash. So back to Amazon I went to look for something that's more bang-for-your-buck. I stumbled upon a bunch of non-mainstream headphones and then eventually to these. I have some Anker chargers and stuff but I never knew Anker made audio hardware, so I thought I'd read some reviews and try them out since they were on sale for $45 vs. their $60 MSRP. I knew now that if I wanted even the slightest decency in quality, I'd have to spend more than $15 haha.Next, let me explain my experience in audio hardware.I wouldn't consider myself a professional audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. My most expensive pair of headphones are my Sennheiser HD 650 for when I dabble in music production or want listen to music at the highest quality pair with my FiiO portable amp interface, my pair of Sony MDR-V6 (my favorite pair of headphones/ studio monitors and ol' faithful), Sennheiser CX 5.00i (hands-down best-sounding and most-balanced earbuds), 2 pairs of Sennheiser CX 300 (best-sounding alternative to the 5.00i), Beats Studio (trash), Beats Solo HD (even more trash), airpods 1st gen, and various pairs of earpods lying around. Hopefully that gives you a small glimpse of how much high-quality audio means to me...or how stupid I am for owning a couple pairs of Beats...NOW FOR THE BREAKDOWN ------Sound Quality ---- 8/10These are actually quite above decent! The price is just a bonus. I'd say the quality as normal headphones for listening to music and gaming, they're perfect. Crisp highs and good lows (with a bit of a default bass-enhancement). The mids could use a bit of work but to be honest, for $45 this is prob some of the best sound you can get at this price-point. Pretty much what a lot of these reviews say. Heck, these may be better than/ as good as most name-brand $100-200. I've used various Bose Quiet Comfort series headphones ($300+) and haven't been impressed with their sound quality. I would say these sound just as good, if not better, than Bose QC headphones, as controversial as that may be to say haha. Another comparison is against my airpods, which I consider pretty good-sounding. I would say these are about the same as airpods, but with added bass and optional added bass on top of that. Beats muddle everything else with their added bass, while these don't IMO. Overall, sound quality on these is solid and for under $60, I would say is a steal.DO NOT USE FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION OR AS STUDIO MONITORSI only say this because there are reasons that these are just meant for listening. There are drivers in these that may not sit well with production hardware, such as an amplified audio interface, preamps, or other equipment. When I plugged this into my FiiO via the provided aux cable, the sound became unbalanced. It's probably because it wasn't meant to take in more power than it was built with, so better to leave these headphones vanilla than add anything else to them. Use them for listening or gaming and you should experience optimal sound quality. Oh and also, DON'T EVER BUY BEATS. These headphones sound eons better than any of the Beats products that I've owned/ tried, including the discontinued $400 Beats Pro.Comfort ---- 10/10These are also quite comfortable. I've worn it as long as 3-hour time period so far and the sides of my head/ ears weren't sore like after long wears of my Sennheiser HD 650s. Just like my Sony MDR-V6s they are foldable, so that may have something to do with the flexibility of its entirety. My Sennheiser HD 650s are non-foldable, and that's a big drawback for those :'(. The memory foam pads covered with faux leather allows the headphones to comfortably conform to your head shape. The only thing I can really compare the comfort to is the Beats Studio, which surprisingly, despite their build quality, are pretty comfortable. Overall, I feel like these would fit most heads and provide almost universal comfort.Features ---- meh, not much to talk aboutReally the only added features are the optional bass-boost and active noise canceling (ANC). The optional bass-boost isn't bad, it just doesn't do much for me because bass is already enhanced right outta the box. So if you're into bass-boosted and bass-heavy music, these will be quite pleasant for sure! The ANC also doesn't really do much for me since I listen to my music loud enough to drown out pretty much everything anyway. But, when I turn it on without music playing, it does do something. It's not quite as effective as the Bose QC headphones, but I think it works pretty well in most loud situations. I just haven't used it on a plane yet haha. The volume control buttons have an annoying beep every time you press + or - , but whatever. This actually sucks- you can't use the headphones while they're charging, even wired. Ridiculous, I know. But hey, can't have everything, right? Big oof on Anker's end on that.Aesthetics ---- 6/10Not gonna lie, these are pretty generic looking headphones. They don't have some revolutionary design to it, but they look like your average good-looking generic headphones. They aren't flashy like Beats or Airpods (or probably the upcoming Airpods Studio) but they don't look bad at all. They're just...normal. But, I did only get the black pair, so maybe the gray one looks better in different settings. Don't let this be a deal-breaker, though.Connectivity ---- 6/10Wired, these things are perfect. The provided cable could be longer, but that's nothing against the headphones themselves. Just buy an extender or a longer cable online for like $10 or less. THE ONLY REASON I'M KNOCKING OFF A STAR is because of what a lot of people are complaining about: the choppiness and clicking of the Bluetooth connectivity. Every now and then the headphones will click or have that split-second static noise while I'm listening via bluetooth. It's not often, but happens enough to dock a start off. Now, I could just return these and try to get another pair, but I'm too lazy and don't really care too much about the clipping every now and then, so that's on me. But, it's a problem a lot of other reviewers are complaining about so it's a legitimate issue. The range is fine so far. I've been able to walk 30 ft. away without any clipping issues. I've also used these for video calls and they work just fine with no clipping.Conclusion ---- Overall grade: 9/10You may or may not find headphones this great-sounding at this price-point or even a step up in price-point, but then again I haven't tried every single pair of headphones on the market. But I can say with confidence that these stack up pretty well against my studio headphones that I own and I would recommend these to anyone looking for decent-sounding headphones, because with these, you'll get way more than what you're looking for. These will definitely be a pleasure to play VR games with and even moreso just listening to music while at home or traveling!Now if you're looking for decent earbuds, I recommend the Sennheiser CX 5.00i! (If you haven't noticed, i'm definitely biased towards Sennheiser, but they're industry-standard and the have the best sounding audio products I've ever experience, hands-down)","October 23, 2020",AF57TFFL4RVTI3RUQXVEO24IMNTQ,True,449.0027,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.18981664470794898,Positive,0.9993,Positive
R1ABEIBHVJQEA4,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Solid choice in budget friendly headphones,Miranda,4,"They're perfect for what I'm using them for-- but definitely read first before buying, because the upgraded version may be what you're looking for.I am incredibly sensitive to headphones (as opposed to earbuds). My head is really sensitive to pressure, and even with light headsets I can start getting a migraine with constant pressure in one spot for too long. My ears also experience the same sensitivity-- they go numb/get tingly pain very easily with on-ear sets.I've been using my Airpod Pros as my go-tos for three years now, but I wanted over-ears for when I'm playing my keyboard piano-- it just gives a better atmospheric sound and nuance, in my opinion. So because of this, it was really important to me to get a pair that could be wired, on top of being bluetooth for versatility. I also prefer a wire option for AIRPLANES! If you ever want to watch an in-flight movie, you still need an aux cable these days. Surprisingly, it was difficult to find a model of headphones that still offer both options. It was a big reason I went with these.CHARGING/BATTERY:The first con is that these use micro USB to charge. Most updated tech is moving to USB-C, and I don't have any other devices that still use micro cables. When I travel with these, I need to remember to bring that designated cord. (Note, the Q20i model has USBC charging) On the other hand, the impressive battery life (60H with ANC off, 40 with it on) does help with that. I also like that it tells you verbally the battery level when you turn them on, so you get a heads up of what the charge is at. However, my apple devices also give me a battery percentage indicator for more accurate levels.EAR CUPS/NOISE CANCELLATION:The over-ear design is so much more comfortable than on-ear, and even helps enhance the active noise cancellation. A lot of external sound is filtered out even with ANC off because of how these cup around your ears snugly (but not too tightly!). My ears fit all the way inside comfortably. As I type this, I have cleaners in my home running a vacuum downstairs and I didn't even notice until I took the headphones off.COMFORT:When I first opened these up and put them on, I felt that the cups were putting slight pressure inward against my head, but after wearing them for ~5hr they seem to have already ""broken in"" and it's not noticeable anymore. As far as the top of the headset, I will say there's not a ton of cushion, but it's enough for these to feel okay for hours on my sensitive head.SIZING:They're not that heavy but they do press down a bit on my head because they're SLIGHTLY large on my head. I'm a 5'4"" woman, I'd say pretty average sized head?? lol - but these do feel a bit big on me. I don't think I would use them for working out or running, something as small as even just looking downward is enough to have them slightly slip. In general I do prefer working out with earbuds anyway just due to sweat, so that's not what I really bought these for anyway but thought I'd mention for any other petite women. Because of this, these are for sure going to be more for piano / computer / travel.BASS/SOUND:I feel like there was mixed reviews about the bass capabilities. Even with the BassUp feature off, I feel like the bass is great on these without distorting! I listen to Billie Eilish a lot, who is known for very bass-heavy music. Without BassUp, her songs sound well balanced (while still obviously bass-heavy). With BassUp on, you get that fuzzy feeling in your ears when the bass kicks in (but still no distortion). Speaking of Billie, she also utilizes stereo sound a lot (some sounds in left ear, some sounds in right) and it sounds great in these. Note that there is no transparency mode on these, but the Q20i model has that if it's a must for you.CONNECTIVITY:This was a big one for me, and probably the reason I am going to be returning these for the upgraded Q20i. I've been spoiled by my Airpods in terms of being able to switch between devices seamlessly (ipad/iphone/imac) without having to disconnect one device and re-pair the other. With this set, I have to go into my iPhone settings, disconnect, then pair with my computer and vice versa whenever I want to switch. It's a small annoyance but a convenience I really prefer.PRICE:I bought these on sale for $39.99 and I feel like that's a super fair price for the quality and buying from a reputable brand like Anker. I have several of their items, and they have great customer service. I'd much rather spend the extra $10-20 from the super off brands here on Amazon, just for the peace of mind that they stand by their products.","March 4, 2024",AEX7BTHOU63GYGKQTAAC6HSPITZA,True,53.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.19971702569916855,Positive,0.9987,Positive
RTYYTUIZAG0EK,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars A Complete Review for the Average Joe,Kathy Tran,5,"This is a review comparing these headphones to the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II, and the Sony WH-1000XM4.Now I know what your thinking - how could you ever compare a cheapo $50 pair of headphones to the $300+ big boys in the noise cancelling world like Bose and Sony? Well these headphones are wireless, bluetooth, active noise cancelling, and promote themselves as comfortable with balanced sound, so in my book all three of these headphones are in the same league.The criteria is simple - I don't use lab equipment to measure, I'm not concerned about exact numbers, and I don't like falling for overblown hype or marketing nonsense. I use my own experience and non-technical knowledge to decide what I like best.The Soundcore Headphones:These headphones are comfortable. Maybe it's because of the 'cheaper' materials, or they are just genuinely made with comfort more in mind, but I can wear these all day with little discomfort. I wear glasses so a little annoyance is unavoidable, but these do a bang up job of not squishing my head, while still making a good seal around my ears to keep sound quality and noise cancelling from bleeding out. I have heard some having issues with durability, but my bose quietcomfort headphones wore out and cracked over time too. Replacements are plentiful and cheap, so it's a non issue for me.Comparability and Software:These are what headphones are meant to be. Simple buttons, simple pairing, no proprietary software that I have to download, no nonsense. Just pair and play. They also have a wired mode if I'm editing video or need them to not have any delay. Bluetooth will always have a bit of a delay, but it's nothing deal breaking, a few milliseconds at most. They do not have multidevice pairing, or absolutely massive bluetooth range (it still works perfectly for me going around my whole house no problem), and there is no EQ balancing, other than the Bass Boost.Overall SoundI'm not a pro audio engineer or audiophile. If it sounds good, it's good to me. I like these headphones in normal mode just fine. While the overall sound stage is fairly tight, and it can sometimes feel cramped with complex or intricate songs, I don't feel overwhelmed in any one way or another. The negative I have here is with their 'bass boost's mode. It's fair to say it does boost the bass, at the cost of literally everything else. It almost makes it sound like every other frequency is underwater when it's turned on. I keep it off 100% of the time - it's bad.Noise Cancelling:Here is the meat and potatoes of the review. I bought these for noise cancelling and noise cancelling alone. I was surprised - they are pretty good. My air conditioner dissolves away. Car noises and wind fade to imperceptible levels, and airplane sounds go completely away. The area it falls short in is human speech. I can still hear people without much difference. Not a killer for me, but slightly lacking in that regard. They also do not give me the headache compression feeling that some other noise cancelling can give me.Comparisons:Comfort - These surprisingly win. The Bose Quietcomforts are very close, but the headpeice is slightly tighter, leading to overall head pressure discomfort over time. The Sonys are even worse, with their high weight and size they can feel heavy over time, and make my ears warm after about 1 hour.Compatibility and Software - These are also the winners! Sony and Bose just cannot help themselves when it comes to collecting data and making their customers sign up for BS accounts. I'm not a super privacy nerd either, but when I have to take a photo of my ears (looking at you Sony!) Just to listen to music, I draw the line. The Quietcomforts are better, but the Bose app is just another step in between me and my music. Bose at least keeps the physical buttons, which I enjoy because touch controls are still a bit picky in 2020. Sony knows this well, as I fumbled and accidentally turned off my music or changed the volume or song accidentally about a dozen times on their headphones. Physical buttons are arguably uglier, but I value practicality over style in this regard. The Sonys also have multidevice pairing, and their bluetooth range is just stupid far, but I don't usually run a whole football field away from my phone at a time.Overall Sound - Sony comes first, followed by Bose, and then the Soundcores. The Sony headphones are very crisp, with a wide sense of space. I genuinely couldnt stop myself from smiling when I first put them on. They induce a sense of awe, and I loved their sound immensely. The Bose was slightly worse, and only a touch better than the Soundcores. Bose has cleaner bass, and a better sense of staging, especially with singing and high hat sounds. If I were to number them by sound the Sonys get a 96, the Bose a 85, and the Soundcores a 82.Noise Cancelling - Sony once again wins, but this time the Bose and Soundcores are tied. I genuinely could not tell the difference between the Bose and Soundcores when my eyes were closed as far as noise cancelling was concered. The Sonys I could though. They do a significant better job with human voices, especially crowds like in restaurants or outside. They are still audible, but pass the point where I cannot understand what people are saying - the Bose and Soundcores fail this test.The Overall:Comparing these headphones is an excercise in diminishing returns. For $50 the Soundcores cover about 90% of what the $300 Bose Quietcomforts offer, and about 85% of what the $350 Sony WH-1000XM4 offer. To me, that remaining 10% and 15% does not justify the additional $250 and $300 price tag. Now maybe you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have the best noise cancelling, or can't live without the absolute cream of the crop perfect soundscape - and in those instances the features may justify the cost. But chances are if you're debating on these headphones you are just the average Joe consumer like me, in which case these headphones will cover everything you need without bogging you down in unnecessary features or quality thay will go unnoticed in 99% of the population. I genuinely like these headphones, and will continue to lovingly give them daily abuse until they fail me. After all, I could buy and break FIVE of these before I reached the price of one pair of Sonys.TL:DR Give them a chance, you'll more than likely find their value apparent.","November 13, 2020",AEBWJZ55L7XV3T354S22VM2GQK7Q,True,449.0027,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.15372885872885875,Positive,0.9972,Positive
R1S4901CIWRKKU,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth every penny!,Eric Muttillo,5,"I bought these while on a trip to visit family, planning on using them for the trip home to cut out the excess noise and have some tunes to close my eyes to, or good audio to watch a movie with on my flight home. I was hoping they could get loud enough with the music to drown out the screaming kids on the flights that inevitably happen every time I fly. Well, I got them and to my pleasant surprise, they outperformed what I was hoping for! I was very pleased with the noise cancelling aspect as it cut down the cabin volume to a near whisper compared to not having these on....combined that with playing some music at about 60 to 75% volume and I literally couldn't hear ANYTHING going on in the cabin of the aircraft....PERFECT! All for like 30 bucks? Man, what's not to like? Also, the sound quality on these was actually really great for the money too, plenty of bass and actually I was hearing things in the music that I listen to that I hadn't heard in other headphones or speaker systems that really surprised me.... WELL DONE Anker! I'll be buying more, but definitely hanging on to these and may end up using them for mowing the lawn now too! Super pleased with this purchase and highly recommend these for the money.","September 5, 2024",AGW2MK3HU64DTXJ5VVOJLF3OOXHA,True,0.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.2839722222222222,Positive,0.9855,Positive
R2MM8Y06CIW6JS,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great for my sanity,Shultz,5,"A particularly noisy coworker had me losing my sanity. I would say overall they are extremely loud and obnoxious. Between the yelling, loud typing, music playing on loud, and slamming things around I was on the verge of losing it and breaking something. I quickly began looking for noise cancelling headphones. After seeing a particular review about these about it helping someone cope with noisy coworkers I was sold.I was skeptical but if anything could help me I was open to it. As I walked into the office the day started with the pounding of the keyboard, and I thought great here we go. As I put them on, the sound deadened. I could hear the typing but very faintly. Once I put the music on I could no longer hear a thing. Keep in mind, prior to this I had regular earphones and would blast them on almost full volume and could still easily hear the typing over the music. I took one side off just to make sure I wasn't imagining things. Yes, the typing was still going I just couldn't hear it. These headphones have possibly saved my job.As far as the headphones itself, when wearing over ear headphones usually after a while near my ears get sore. So far I have been able to wear these for the entire work day with no issues. The battery life is great and lasts all day without charging. I often forget to put them back on the charger and they still last the following day. I don't think I can risk having these not charged so I can't say for sure how long it lasts but its at least a few days.I'm not a music connoisseur so I can't speak for the quality of the bass, etc. I just know it plays the music.I think the only negative thing would be if I need to take the earphones off there isn't really a comfortable position for it on my head. When hanging around my neck it is fairly large and feels like a neck brace and putting it on my head with one side off feels kind of awkward. But pretty minor since I can just put them down if I really need to.All in all very happy with these headphones and especially for the price. Can't speak for the durability since I've only had them for about a month now.","July 10, 2024",AGRSYJS23UXZGVY3S24ATSSGE6AA,True,4.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.10888543823326433,Positive,0.9699,Positive
R13B39VKZ1A1YA,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Passive Noise Reduction. Great Active Noise Reduction. Blocks TV Sound In The Same Room.,Cynthia Greer,5,"These work really well. I have a 10 year old that prefers to watch videos on his iPad with headphones in the same room that my wife and I use to watch TV shows. A lot of the shows that stream these days have language I really don't need my 10 year old to hear. I've been looking for a pair of headphones that can block the TV sound so we don't have to turn it down really low. These headphones do the trick. They block about 60-65% of the TV sound with nothing playing on the iPad. The moment you play sound through them, you can't make out anything that's coming from the TV. If you turn on the active noise reduction as well, it blocks 90-95% of the TV sound. I don't usually bother with that since passive works so well and the battery lasts a lot longer if you just use them for Bluetooth.My main finding in researching all this is that active noise reduction alone doesn't actually cancel out normal conversation. It's not quick enough for that. It's only useful at blocking out sounds that don't change much like air conditioners, fans, plain engines, etc. It does help a little on these headphones, though. I'm assuming it's because the passive works so well that whats left is just kind of a mumble. And it was able to reduce that even further.","August 21, 2024",AHMZ3XVOT46MA7PVTLFM6AOZHM2Q,True,1.0,Color: Blue,Soundcore Anker,0.10271400226757368,Positive,0.8675,Positive

Normally I wouldn't even think about writing a review, but these headphones are SO. DANG. GOOD... that I have to.I went looking for a cheaper alternative to my Bose QC35's that I bought several years ago since they stopped working. I loved those. They were exceptionally comfortable and the sound quality was fantastic. But since they are now trash... I needed something else.I didn't particularly want to spend that kind of QC35 money again so these caught my eye immediately. Once I started scrolling through the tremendous amount of reviews and liking what I saw, I went ahead and pulled the trigger on this purchase.

R1S536IXZEUC8M,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive compare to AAA companies!,GalaxyCat,5,"Ive bought Philips brand and it was garbage, broke in 3 months, bad customer service, refused help and refund and doesnt cover even faulty damage. Sony i bought and it was better but the ears would start to hurt and have to take them off after 20 minutes. These Anker Q20 i was actually impressed. It has this weird sound cancelling that you can even turn off! How does a headset turn off noise cancelling! Ive had AWIA old school sound cancelling headset over ear headphones with good bass and it did the same thing but without the technology of turning it off. This one you press a button and it turns off the cancelling and boy it makes a big difference. You wont even hear your phone go off so let that be a warning to keep your phone in front of you when you use these. You wont hear a thing! The bass is so good, you dont need to turn it off. There is none of this soft thud of failure where you press a button and you get a tiny bit of bass. Its stupid for headsets to have that but this one is like having a subwoofer in the headset. BOOM BOOM. The battery life is good, and the quality of the plastic is good. Its not like the trash failure of Philips where it was designed to crack so you can spend more money buying another one, thats why they said NO we dont cover cosmetic damages but this one its flexible, and its impressive for an Anker item. Ive bought lots of products from Anker but never heard of them making a headset. So i tried it. This would save you hundreds of dollars, no need to spend $200 on an expensive Boss or Sony, this will match those brands easy. If you are reading this deciding if you should buy it, yes, buy it. Dont waste your money on anything else like i did. If they offer it, get a warranty on this too so if it does something it shouldnt you can get it replaced.","July 20, 2024",AHGM73IFPGQ3XBWDT2SDB3GY6U7Q,True,9.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.14134615384615384,Positive,0.9451,Positive

Right now, my neighbor is blaring music in his yard, but I can't hear it at all even sitting in my own yard about 20ft away.I just wish the ear cups were a tiny bit larger because I don't like things pressing on my ears, but they are the best over-the-ear phones I've found in a very long time.The also last a very, very long time. I haven't honestly run out of battery yet and charge them every time I stop using them, but I have listened continuously for about 4 hours a few times, and it never said it was low battery.It does take some getting used to the controls, but once you do, it's easy!I'm so happy I found these, and for the price, you can't go wrong. The sound quality is amazing, it even has a noise control mode that blocks out even more sound if you need to. It even works when you aren't actually listening to something and just want some brown noise to block things out. (At least it sounds like brown noise to me) they charge quickly, as well.If you're on the fence because ""how can cheaper be better?""

R2D3JQNSGVXHJC,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars What noise?,Jaybirdexpress,5,"I got these headphones to replace a set that had gone the way of the Dodo. Noise cancellation is very important to me. The noise cancellation on that pair just wasn’t good enough to block out the sound of the muffler on my riding mower. The muffler was, as we say it, broken in, with the emphasis on broken. After I saw the jaw dropping cost of replacing the muffler at my local John Deere dealer, I decided that rather than empty my bank account right now, I’d just search for a pair of noise cancelling headphones that were a notch up compared to the bargain basement NC phones I usually bought. And that’s how and why I bought these Life Q20’s .I did some searching for the best NC ‘phones, but most of them were so expensive I wouldn’t wear them outside for fear of ruining them in some unfortunate riding mower incident, like the headphones I ran over after swatting away a wasp while I was on the machine. They didn't come out of so well. Either did the wasp.I was about to give up the search when I came across these phones featured on an audio site. A comparison between the upscale headphones-and by that I mean “expensive” brand name phones, and these Anker Life Q20’s, was revealing. The Q20”s met many of those same specs, and the Q20’s had a noise cancelling range was that was on par or better than many of these name brands.And it’s not just ambient noise cancellation that makes this product good. The fidelity of music over the Bluetooth link was just as amazing. I was truly impressed with both of these features, and the fit and finish of this product was just good.Good price, good product, And, as an added bonus, if you have trouble hearing the actors’ voices in those streaming Netflix movies, and your TV has a Bluetooth feature, this thing will cure that instantly.Maybe I should just give my neighbors a pair.

R8A53BVTBUUTM,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Best ANC and Sound in it's price range!,Wendell Powell,5,"First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.Active Noise Cancellation:Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..Sound:I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..Quality:The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!Functionality:A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!Battery:The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!Packaging:The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly..

R3FA6PH15G6ED3,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable with excellent noise cancellation for the price,S. Hoffman,5,"I go through a lot of over-the-ear headphones because I sleep with them. I've probably bought 5 pair this year alone because they've either broken or no longer take a charge. I like these because they're comfortable, have better than average (for the price) noise-cancellation, have excellent sound, can go a couple of days without a charge, are about at the ~$50 mark, which is about as much as I want to spend on them. I like these so much that I'm going to buy a couple more pair; one to keep at my desktop computer and a couple of pair for my kids. The only thing these are missing over a JBL set I bought urgently from a retail store is the ability to connect to multiple phones and automatically switch to whichever was producing sound.","August 30, 2024",AFO6TVGFQJQSJQKGMWNI6EEMRMUA,True,0.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.2192307692307692,Positive,0.8402,Positive

R1PWVCZXJUOXCS,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Does This Battery EVER Die?,Angela,5,"Seriously though. I got this set of headphones against my husband's recommendations - he was like ""it's too inexpensive, there must be a higher quality version out there""... but after reading the reviews and listening to my gut, I got them anyway. With a single exception, I've never been disappointed in an Anker product, and I figured it was worth a shot.I charged them when I got them (April 26, 2024) and have been using them intermittently (once or twice a week for a few hours at a time, max 8 hours) but regularly. I have yet to recharge them - they're sitting pretty at 30% battery life as I write this on July 19, 2024.Now to be fair, I'm not using them to their fullest extent: I mostly listen to audiobooks, don't really use the voice capabilities, and haven't used the noise-cancelling feature much (honestly, the cushioning of the headphones meet almost all of my needs). Even with my relatively limited use, I'm floored at how long the battery has lasted.Battery is always my main concern with a bluetooth device, but the audio quality is nothing to slouch at either - typical Anker excellence.Yes, there's a newer version of this same set of headphones out there, and yes, there's plenty of other options. But THESE are the smart choice. No regrets from this picky consumer. Five stars, would buy again (except with this battery life I probably won't ever need to!).","July 19, 2024",AFWGDY2ESE4JCCEBFNMJEV624Z6A,True,1.0,Color: Blue,Soundcore Anker,0.07377976190476189,Positive,0.9026,Positive
R1V2HAPIO5YL64,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars No noise cancelling, instead this is more like pump up the volume",William Yousef Fadel,4,"Normally, Anker products are really good, but these are dissapointing.If these where just headphones, they would be fine, they are comfortable, sound good (not audiophile good, but good enough), look kinda good (if a tad cluncky). But these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones. And they do not cancel noise at all.The only discernible effect when you enable noise cancelling is that the headphones pump up the volume of what you are listening, but, once you compensate for that, the external sound dampening you get is the same that you would get by just the cushions of the headphones.Mind you, I tested with a punny Nokia E71 playing TMBG's Call_connected_through_the_NSA.mp3 not some hollywood explosion fest. I do not want ""world around dissapears"" kinds of Noise Cancelling, but if these can't cancel a punny E71... Well, disappointed/dissapointingEdit #1:The reason I hold Anker in high regard, I because of their customer service, and this is no exception. I posted the review in about July 18, 2020, and today July 21, 2020 they contacted me. At least we know they still have top notch customer support, even during a pandemic.Nonetheless, their sugestions were not very usefull:«- Make sure the NC button is turned on(the NC indicator would turn green) when you want them to cancel noise outside.»Yes, I know very well how to press the button to get the green light, and also, a very nice lady voice says ""Noice Cancelling"", so yes, I was 110% (one hundred and ten percent) sure noice cancelling was active.«- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference.»Well, we are under lockdown. When I am able to move out, I have more important thing to do than test noise cancelling headphones. Nonetheless, I'll try to do it and report back to Anker Customer Support, and to you guys. I'll also try to get the 10 min silent MP3s from Samir Mezrahito really test this out.Edit #2:I was ""finally"" able to actuate on Anker product support's sugestion and ""- Try the headphones in different noisy places with NC on and off and see any difference."".For testing purposes I used the headphones in BlueThooth mode (to eliminate any electrical intereference noise). And used the song ""A a a a a a a a a Very good song"" by artist Samir Mezrahi, which, as you perhaps know, consists of almost 10 min of silence.I tested in various scenarios:1.) In my car, windows down.2.) In my car windows up.3.) Reving up my car to 2500rpm (in the parking lot).4.) In a bus stop (with buses comming in and out).5.) In the electric stairs of a ghostly empty shopping mall.6.) In a queue to pay for medicines (with ambient music and people talking at moderate volume).7.) Near the air extractor of my home kitchen.My results:1.) If wind blows in the headphones you actually get MUCH MORE noise with NC on than with NC off, so forget using the noise cancelling in a ferry boat, or in a bus with no Air conditioning, or in your car with windows/roof open, or in your bike.2.) The NC was able to diminish humming noises (like the engine), but not clacking noises, or noises derived from potholes and such.3.) The NC was very effective at mitiganting the reeving.4.) The engine noise from the buses was mitigated, but not the clacking or the chatter from the people waiting.5.) Again, the humm of the motor of the staris was mitigated, but not the clacking noises.6.) In the queue, the souund of the air conditioner or the store was somewhat mitigated by the NC, but not the ambient music or the chatter, and that actually ended up being worse, because it made more noticeable the music and chatter.7.) The NC was decent with the air extractor of my kitchen.But, in scenarios 5, 6 & 7, I noticed that the NC tends to cancel the low frequencies, but the high ones are not mitigated at all (currently at my 47yo, i can hear up to 15Khz, so for younger peiople is probably worse), so, actually enabling NC will make any high pitch noice more noticeable (i.e. the frequency responce of the NC is not flat).Finally, if one bought these headphones with NC because the noise made by rain, the AC fan or compressor, or some other noise like that was disturbing, it it will diminish it a little (but not much), but if one bought noise cancelling headphones because one wanted to evade the sound of coworkers talking, or kids playing in the garden or your SO watching TV in the other room, these headphones will do nothing more than what headphones with no NC (and therefore less expensive) would have.Edit #3 (and Final):Anker contacted me, and offered two options, return the item (as a very special consideration, since I am a few MONTHS completely outside of the return window), or get a refund for 20% of the cost, to get a more suitable Item. Since I order to the USoA and then have my Items forwarded to Venezuela, it is a hassle to return Items, so I opted for the refund, and it went smoothly.That is the good thing of going with Anker. The litmus test of a good company comes when things go wrong, and Anker has a stellar reputation for making things right. Upgraded the review from one star to 4, but not on the account of the product itself, but rahter, due to the excellent customer service.","July 18, 2020",AF2NHPCDCZUYJXEC4KAFWB73FFRA,True,18.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.20261752136752137,Positive,0.9953,Positive

I have everything from Loop ear plugs to noise-canceling ear buds to sound machines to big speakers. I have a condition that makes certain sounds nd frequencies quite painful. Until now, every device I have tried had failed to provide complete relief. I wasn't expecting much of the Soundcore Q20 headphones, but if you struggle with sound sensitivity, you know the desperation for relief. My biggest battle has been my next door neighbor's lawn service, which uses equipment that measures over 90dB INSIDE my house with all the windows closed. I usually have to leave the house the moment I hear the truck pull up. Not anymore! I put the Soundcore Q20s to the test just this week, fully expecting that the lawn equipment (particularly the gas-powered leaf blowers) would make it through like it does all other devices I own, but it didn't! I was stunned! Even between songs, the noise cancellation kept my ears protected from the auditory assault I usually have to leave the house to escape. These are worth their weight in gold! I cannot recommend them enough. And in addition to being absolutely excellent at what they're designed to do, they provide great sound quality for music and they fit very comfortably. I don't usually like having things on or around my ears but these are quite tolerable. The cushioning feels nice, and there is more cushioning on the part that goes on top of your head. Oh, and the battery life? Phenomenal!! These charge quickly and the charge lasts for a very long time! Bottom line: whether you deal with hyperacusis, misophonia, sensory processing disorder, or just really value your peace and quiet, GET THESE. There are brands out there that cost a lot more and promise a better experience, but these are BY FAR superior to anything else I have ever tried. They will not disappoint!

Placement is good and easy to use when on my head. Noise canceling works very well actually very quiet even without noise canceling on and works well for phone calls. I have even had people comment that it was clearer when i switched from my EarPod pros to this head set. Thinking of buying a few more to give away as gifts. Would purchase again.

I have tried noise cancelling ear buds and didn't find any difference from the ones I use normally, so I took a chance after doing a lot of research on these Anker headphones. First, they are lightweight, fit perfectly and the biggest first surprise was that they were fully charged in about 2 hours, maybe less. I popped them on and immediately all sounds were muted. I told my hubby that these were really nice and I thought he was joking with me, mouthing words but not talking. Nope, talking in a normal voice, but all I heard was a soft murmur. I highly recommend these to anyone who needs a quiet environment to read, study, listen to books (which is what I do) or music.

Can't comment on noise cancellation - I care not for it. Decent volume output. Just use the minjack on the front output of your PC as that is equipped with a mic booster or you will get really soft output from using a back mic output (bluetooth has no such limitations). I'm happy. Can I get better for twice the price? Sure I just have different priorities. I treat them will definite care as with rough handling them light not last, but I treat all my kit with kid gloves. PS: they fit comfortably over my ears and have a night weight - JBL's are far lighter.

I put on the test songs and the amount of bass that came out of these and the sound quality of it gave me goosebumps all over!

I started looking for some over the ear headphones bc, as a mom to a small baby, I spend a lot of time awake at night on my phone trying to stay awake! I have regular Apple ear buds and never liked them bc they don’t stay in my ear at all. I chose this soundcore product bc it had the best reviews and was in my budget. I was immediately in love. I’m no expert in sound by no means but I do love music and love when things sound so clear and crisp. This delivers so well in that. The noise cancelling is my favorite part. As a mom to a very wild toddler, I can get overstimulated to the max. This makes it so that I can hear the screaming and laughing but it sounds like through a mile long tunnel, which is PERFECT. I’m sure other people would like more noise reduction but this is amazing for me to lessen all the noise but still be alert if needed. I suffer from migraines so the fit is a huge aspect to me. They seem very comfortable so far but using them for longer will surely tell. I wish there were more colors like a pale pink but I got the silver color and it is girly enough for me! It’s something I’d definitely wear outside the house at the gym or on a walk. They haven’t gone through a drop test yet which I’m sure they will bc again, wild toddler. But they seem to be durable and not super cheaply made. I do wish there was a hard case as all it came with was a rubber plastic bag. I’m sure I could find something cheap on Amazon though to fit. Overall, I LOVE IT.

Additionally, these headphones take forever to turn off. It seriously takes 6-7 seconds of holding down the power button for them to turn off.

R3L3SZ6RUZTBSX,B07NM3RSRQ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sounding, but not without their flaws",Debbie Wiggins,4,"These headphones are a great value. They are extremely lightweight and sound quality is very good. Noise cancelling works well and is not far off from their more expensive counterparts. My main complaint with these is the size of the ear cups. They are quite small and just barely qualify as ""over ear"" headphones in my opinion. Part of the ear cup actually sat on top of my ear lobes. I found that this design along with the faux-leather material used made my ears overheat too quickly. That being said, I have issues with my ears getting hot with most headphones that I have tried, so take that with a grain of salt.It is important to mention that I could not get the noise cancelling feature to work when these were functioning off of the included cable. If you plan to use these wirelessly just for listening to music from your phone this likely isn't an issue, but I was considering using these for gaming so this did not fit my use case. In addition, I feel that these do not sound nearly as good with noise cancelling turned off. When noise cancelling is on, they sound amazing. With it off, however, they sound quite cheap and the clarity seems to decrease. I'm not sure what would cause this, but that is just my experience with them.I got these on sale for $40, so these are definitely a great value at that price point. If the negatives I mentioned are not deal breakers for you, I highly recommend picking these up when they are on sale.","June 4, 2024",AHSWFP7XSW3WSEK2XFIOZOMVMP2A,True,3.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.22839285714285715,Positive,0.9802,Positive

R5SDX41KD57A9,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones,Steven Lavey,5,"I've been using thease headphones for a while now and I feel like I've tested them enough to give a long term review. The headphones work great from day 1. They came partially charged. Disregarding the advice of plugging in and giving a full charge before use, used it all the way to see how long it would take to fully charge. First full charge was about 2 hours. Every full charge has been between 30 to 90 minutes. This is due to the quality of charger and cord used. In the instructions it says it has a quick charge mode where 5 minutes of charge gives 2 hours. I've found this is incorrect. 5 minutes of charge gives about 2.5 hours of use at minimum. I can usually get a full or nearly full charge at 45 minutes at average. Standby mode with headphones is the longest I've seen. I powered on the headphones and needed to do something, forgot about it until 2 days later. At 2 days standby with Noise cancelation on, the charge was about 20%. Noise cancelation works great. I've been using the headphones while doing woodworking. I doubt the headphones are OSHA approved but they work great with background noise. When I was listening to anything, I did not need to adjust the volume to hear anything. While I know this company as a very reliable company for USB cords and chargers, the headphones and earbuds they make are some of the best I've used and an excellent value. The only recommendation I would make is to change the charging port from micro USB to USB C, but I'm sure they've already corrected it with other models. There's not many companies out there that I'd ever consider myself a fan of, let alone recommend their products to close family members, this company is certainly one I do. The fit if the headphones are perfect, even with people who wear glasses.","April 28, 2024",AEQCO42XNU4WFC6TTDMJOKFJNB5A,True,11.0,Color: Blue,Soundcore Anker,0.28384353741496604,Positive,0.993,Positive

They are super comfortable to wear for hours on end. And to that same point, the battery is amazing! Connectivity is quick and simple. They are not too bulky or heavy as i worried they would and try to slide off of i tilted my head too far. The sound quality is there and they really are noise canceling.

R3QAPNJ0V6TB8M,B07NM3RSRQ,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise canceling without even turning on the noise canceling function!,Katie D.,4,"I have never really been a big fan of these massive headphones, but I was taking an extremely long flight and needed more than the 3 hour battery life my airpods offer. I would give these a 5 star overall review, but they are just a touch too big for my head, even at the smallest setting. I made it work for the trip but i do think it put a bit of pressure on my ears, despite some of the others reviews. If you have a normal or larger head, these will probably fit great! (I have to buy kids hats if that says anything about my tiny noggin')Overall, the battery life is incredible and these were perfect for using with the airplane screens (via 3mm jack) as well as my bluetooth on my phone. I personally think the silence they bring when you put them on even without turning on the noise canceling feature is fantastic. I really didn't have an need to turn on the feature for this particular trip. I have numerous other Anker products and I knew the sound quality should be good and it definitely was! I will say overall sound/bass sounds much better than my usual headphones.

R8FJIV29I1F67,B07NM3RSRQ,"5.0 out of 5 stars Really nice headphones, works for sensitive heads too",T.M.,5,"Very pleasantly surprised, they are really nice.I have an extremely sensitive head and any pressure gives me headaches, so over ear headphones never work for me, but I saw a video recommending them for people like me, so gave it a try.Since getting them I wear them all the time, after several hours or on bad allergy days I do get a bit of a headache, but otherwise they are very comfortable, the squishy soft material is nice, and they're very light and gentle.Sound wise they sound great, and the mic seems to work good as well.For ANC, I originally thought it was supposed to mute outside sounds so I was disappointed, you can still hear well while wearing them, but it does soften noise.A few days ago the q30 was on sale and decided to try them for the better ANC (and the pink color lol), and there's very little difference between the two headphones, but I'm no sound aficionado.For the q30, the ANC and sound is customizable, the frame feels more sturdy, the ear cups are a tiny bit larger so slightly more comfortable on the ears, and it has USBC.Overall very nice, for some the q30 is definitely worth the extra $20, but for the average person who doesn't need the fancier sound tech, the q20 is just as good.I was leaning towards keeping the q30, but they're about 14grams heavier and my stupidly sensitive head can't wear them as long as the q20 T-T.I wish they'd make pink q20s...","June 10, 2024",AHAUXVMB3X6IEVKLYM5QY4C4ODQA,True,0.0,Color: Silver,Soundcore Anker,0.2028125,Positive,0.9892,Positive

R3L3H4KCFQM4L,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars These are excellent headphones!,Nkco Tigerman 🐅,5,"NEW REVIEW: I gotta give this 5 stars. I wasn't particularly fascinated by how low the sound was at first, especially with my music player mediums being at full volume... BUT THEN I eventually realized that the Noise Cancellation feature had something to do with that, so I turned it off. The EQ quality is spotless; the clarity and balance is top notch! The bass boost is very enjoyable, the product aesthetic is excellent, I love that it comes with a case for carrying and packing, the buttons are straightforward, and the headphones seem to fit well over small heads and big heads, Haha! Audiophile folks may indulge in the ANC technology, but I prefer it with that feature off because more power is needed to make the sonics more attractive to me. I prefer my headphones and earbuds to be loud enough for me to fully submerge myself in the music, so I can drown in the frequencies to catch the vibe of each song.I started with ""New Review"" because this is a modification of my prior review. I deleted my old review after discovering that turning off the ANC feature gives me the kind of loudness I enjoy when listening to music. It increased the performance of the headphones for me.","May 24, 2024",AHFXESDXT5IPIGMGNBKGIFZUE2OA,True,0.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.290347923681257,Positive,0.9907,Positive

R3ARINYZ9M6PGD,B07NM3RSRQ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones!,Jaden Brunson,5,"The media could not be loaded. I bought these headphones on January 24th, 2024 for $59.99 (I always like when people add price and date so I can see if the “sale” is actually even a sale.)So far, I am LOVING these headphones. I’m a musician’s wife and mom of an autistic kiddo, so we had a chance here to test just how good they sound and how well the noise canceling works. Myself and my husband both agreed that they have really good sound for $60 headphones! They’re also fairly light, not too light that they feel cheap but they are light especially compared to my Bose headphones that were smaller. They are WAY more comfortable than my Bose headphones, and I wear glasses. My Bose ones would sandwich the arms of my glasses between my head and ears and would hurt so bad by the end of the day. But with these, I wear them for 8 hour shifts every single day and so far no pain whatsoever from my glasses. I also love that you can also have noise canceling on or off while your music is playing, which is helpful at my job because I still need to hear when someone approaches me and starts to talk so I usually have it off. But at home, with my husband being a musician like I mentioned- it’s nice that if I’m wanting to listen to something I can have noise canceling on and listen to my music or podcasts when he’s working in his studio.The noise canceling works really well! It’s not 100%, but I prefer that so I can still be aware of my surroundings. The video here is of my autistic daughter, she had noise sensitivities but they’re not severe- enough that she gets upset sometimes when her dad is recording drums. Today we decided to try these headphones with the noise canceling on with no music, and she had not a single care in the world so clearly it does make a huge difference. Usually she would cover her ears with her hands if she was sitting where she is in the video, which shares a wall with the studio. The only time she doesn’t cover her ears is when she’s 3 walls away, so for her to be right next to the studio just chillin with the headphones means they definitely work. She has noise canceling headphones that are specifically made just for that, they don’t have Bluetooth or audio jack capabilities so they’re specifically for noise canceling and she hates those- I think they’re too tight and heavy because they’re filtering out basically all sound completely. She’s 100% content with these on though and I feel that speaks to the comfort.I’m not a headphone snob, but I know a decent pair of headphones when I have them. These are a solid choice if you just want an overall good pair of headphones! When these finally do give up- I’ll update this review. They are still brand new essentially but at this point I’m VERY happy with them.","January 28, 2024",AEWFXCRO6LA2QL6FZW6U7CCLW34Q,True,91.0,Color: Black,Soundcore Anker,0.1880317146621494,Positive,0.9885,Positive
